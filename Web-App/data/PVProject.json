This player takes a stick made of wood or aluminum and holds it at the ready to hit a small ball that one player pitches to them from the center of the playing field. The batter is allowed three tries to hit the ball before they are \"out\". Each team is allowed three outs per inning. Another way a player can get \"out\" is if they run to a base but the teammate manning that base from the other team catches the baseball before the player from the opposing team gets to the base. There are three bases and once a player runs around all three and returns to home plate where they originally started, they score a run. There is much more to the game and rules but this a basic crash course of the game.",

Internationally, all of the competitive gymnastic events are governed by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG). Each country has its own national governing body (BIW) affiliated to FIG. Competitive artistic gymnastics is the best known of the gymnastic events. It typically involves the women's events of uneven bars, balance beam, floor exercise, and vault. Men's events are floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars, and the high bar. Gymnastics evolved from exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included skills for mounting and dismounting a horse, and from circus performance skills.",

The 51-year-old school bus driver was working on an evacuation drill with students outside the Middlebury Academy at the time of the accident.\n\nPolice say Zborowski pushed a 10-year-old girl out of the way to safety when a bus started rolling backwards. Moments later, she was struck and later died at the hospital.\n\nLong-time neighbor, Steven Mikel, says he's not surprised by her heroism. \"Your character comes through when the chips are down. You react,\" Mikel told WKYC. \"You don't think I want to be around for my son.\"\n\nDeanna Morrow, a long-time friend and neighbor, says Zborowski leaves behind a 12-year-old son, Tyrese. Morrow said she had raised her son mostly as a single mother and had moved up to Ohio from Texas.\n\n\"Really he didn't have a lot of family,\" Morrow said of the son. \"It was just him and his mom for a long time, and then his dad finally came back in the picture. I'm hoping his dad's there for him now.\"\n\nMorrow used to babysit Tyrese and reports her children grew up with him. Morrow said both son and mother are good people.\n\n\n\n",

        "script": "Egg-Drop Challenge\nPurpose:  \nAssigned to design and build a simulated model scale drop delivery system that would protect the cargo (a raw egg) from the distance of Centennial’s rotunda.\nEquipment:  \nMy Egg-Drop contraption is made of Straws, paper towel roll, rubber bands, tape, and plastic grocery bags\nProcedure:\n1. Widen the paper towel roll\n2. Reroll the paper towels\n3. Put the straws around the roll.\n4. Rubber band the straws to the roll\n• I weighed and measured my device.\n• I dropped my device from 5.3m in the air and my device landed on the bendy straw legs then fell on to its side. My egg survived.\n• We were judged on the dimensions, amount of supplies used, creativity, and the condition of the egg after being dropped from 5.3m in the air.\n5.  We were suppose to have a minimum of five supplies\n6.  The data was calculated\n \nConclusion:\n• My device worked because, I used straws to absorb some of the force of the drop. I also had grocery bags in the paper towel roll to prevent the egg from dropping out the bottom or in case the device flipped on its top.\n• I also intentionally placed stronger straws on the outside of the paper towel roll above the bendy straws, to absorb the force in case it fell over on its side.\n• I had to split the paper towel roll to make it bigger, and more paper towels could have been added to guarantee that the device would work.\n• For a higher height, I would use longer bendy straws and more of them around the outside of the paper towel roll.\n \n \n \n",

        "script": "A Little Video About ME!\r\n\r\nThis video is a Grade Level Language Arts assignment TEKS, 1st 6 weeks, 2014-15 School Year\r\n\r\nMy name is Mrs. Raymond, and I am a grade level teacher in the Dallas area.\r\n\r\nMy family consists of seven people, my husband, Tim and I, my sons, Christian and Nick, my daughter, Allie, and my husband’s sons, Atticus and Finbar.  We also have a Chihuahua named Bella and a fish.  My husband and I like to go antiquing, walking and garden together.\r\n\r\nMy favorite things to collect are antiques.  I find it interesting to collect tools, furniture, and pottery from a time gone by.  I find the craftsmanship elegant.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite hobbies is gardening.  It is interesting to take a blank piece of grass and plant many different colors and textures that draw different birds and flying insects.\r\n\r\nMy favorite place that I have visited is New York City.  As a photography enthusiast there are so many grand places and things to photograph.  Above is the nigh-time view of the city from the top of the Empire State Building.\r\n\r\nMy favorite book is The Best of Me from Nicholas Sparks.  I have enjoyed several of his books.  Several of his books have become movies that I have enjoyed as well, and this movie is due to release in October.  It will be interesting to see if it will be as good as the book.\r\n\r\nMy favorite subject in school was always and still is anything computer related.  It amazes me the potential of education through technology.\r\n\r\nMy best friend is my husband, Tim. He warms my heart, makes me laugh, causes me to roll my eyes, brings out the best in me, shakes his head at the silliest of me, and accepts the worst of me and I of him.\r\n\r\nThat is a little story about me…\r\n",

        "script": "The Story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\n\nGrimm's Fairy Tale version - translated by Margaret Hunt - language modernized a bit by Leanne Guenther\n\n\nOnce upon a time, long, long ago a king and queen ruled over a distant land.  The queen was kind and lovely and all the people of the realm adored her.  The only sadness in the queen's life was that she wished for a child but did not have one. \n\nOne winter day, the queen was doing needle work while gazing out her ebony window at the new fallen snow.  A bird flew by the window startling the queen and she pricked her finger.  A single drop of blood fell on the snow outside her window.  As she looked at the blood on the snow she said to herself, \"Oh, how I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony.\"  \n\nSoon after that, the kind queen got her wish when she gave birth to a baby girl who had skin white as snow, lips red as blood, and hair black as ebony.  They named the baby princess Snow White, but sadly, the queen died after giving birth to Snow White.\n\nSoon after, the king married a new woman who was beautiful, but as well proud and cruel.  She had studied dark magic and owned a magic mirror, of which she would daily ask, \n\nMirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?\n\nEach time this question was asked, the mirror would give the same answer, \"Thou, O Queen, art the fairest of all.\"  This pleased the queen greatly as she knew that her magical mirror could speak nothing but the truth.\n\nOne morning when the queen asked, \"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?\" she was shocked when it answered:\n\nYou, my queen, are fair; it is true.\nBut Snow White is even fairer than you.\nThe Queen flew into a jealous rage and ordered her huntsman to take Snow White into the woods to be killed.  She demanded that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart as proof. \n\nThe poor huntsman took Snow White into the forest, but found himself unable to kill the girl.  Instead, he let her go, and brought the queen the heart of a wild boar.\n\nSnow White was now all alone in the great forest, and she did not know what to do.  The trees seemed to whisper to each other, scaring Snow White who began to run.  She ran over sharp stones and through thorns.  She ran as far as her feet could carry her, and just as evening was about to fall she saw a little house and went inside in order to rest.\n\nInside the house everything was small but tidy.  There was a little table with a tidy, white tablecloth and seven little plates.  Against the wall there were seven little beds, all in a row and covered with quilts.\n\nBecause she was so hungry Snow White ate a few vegetables and a little bread from each little plate and from each cup she drank a bit of milk. Afterward, because she was so tired, she lay down on one of the little beds and fell fast asleep.\n\nAfter dark, the owners of the house returned home.  They were the seven dwarves who mined for gold in the mountains.  As soon as they arrived home, they saw that someone had been there -- for not everything was in the same order as they had left it.\n\nThe first one said, \"Who has been sitting in my chair?\"\n\nThe second one, \"Who has been eating from my plate?\"\n\nThe third one, \"Who has been eating my bread?\"\n\nThe fourth one, \"Who has been eating my vegetables?\"\n\nThe fifth one, \"Who has been eating with my fork?\"\n\nThe sixth one, \"Who has been drinking from my cup?\"\n\n",

Ray Rice, recently released by the Baltimore Ravens, and Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson won't play either.\nPeterson was placed on the inactive list late last week after he was indicted by a grand jury in Texas on a child abuse charge. He tweeted a photo on Sunday of a highlighted religious devotion that cautions people against passing judgment.",

I would like to remind you that I expect 11 players to show up so if you are thinking that you may wake up to cold, rainy and snowy weather and think twice about playing, I would advice sitting it out until spring. If just a few of you would like to play, you may want to combine with like minded players from other teams to compete under the Emerald City Banner or another. When we reassemble in the Spring I would hope the team would look a lot like it looks now with a few tweeks that you guys may incorporate. Like IU said we are getting feelers. ",

We were also very excited to introduce the iTOi Video Desktop Studio to the both of you, as we are sure it will change the way you do business going forward.  When you cannot be face-to-face, you should be eye-to-eye!\r\n\r\nI love your excitement to learn more about the iTOi Video Desktop Studio.   I took a screenshot of the life insurance policy you sent Hernan as an example of how you can include files for your clients. \r\n\r\nIncluding pictures takes the pressure of having your picture on the video the entire time as I demonstrate in this video.  If I can provide any additional information, please ask.\r\n\r\nThank you again.\r\n\r\n",

        "script": "Elevator pitch: Noticias Mi Ciudad\rMi nombre es Christy Quesada, comunicadora y máster en gestión de sistemas de saludl... Lo que voy a contarles no es una historia convencional, se trata de Mi Ciudad, Tu Ciudad, Nuestra Ciudad.\rYo desperté de un mundo de esos olvidados, opacados por la rutina... Salí de un cuento para pasarme a otro... a un mundo que cobrara vida... Y así conocí Noticias Mi Ciudad... (puede enseñar el libro o el ppt).\rHoy usted también puede cambiarse de cuento después de escuchar lo que relatan los antiguos escritos... La Organización Mundial de la Salud dice que los problemas mentales, incluyendo el estrés, representan el 12% del total de la carga global de las enfermedades.\rLo que pasa es que esas viejas historias tapan muchos detalles. Aproximadamente 350 millones de personas en nuestro mundo están experimentando depresión, estrés o ansiedad. Y si hablamos de nuestra ciudad, Costa Rica, se han encontrado 31.000 incapacidades, con inversiones cerca de 6.373 millones de colones para comprar fármacos, sedantes o antidepresivos.\rNOVEDAD DEL SERVICIO\rPor eso, quisimos convertirnos en STORYTELLERS reales porque estudios demuestran que leer fantasía al menos seis minutos diarios puede reducir el estrés en un 68%. Creamos Noticias Mi Ciudad, emprendimiento que ofrece contenido real convertido en fantasía para mantener al público informado sin estrés y así promover salud mental, empatía y relaciones sociales. Es la combinación de salud mental y fantasía que lo hace novedoso.\rCOMPETENCIA TÉCNICA\rNoticias Mi Ciudad opera como persona física. Christy es la creadora y trabaja con freelancers a nivel latinoamericano. Entre ellos se encuentran: animadores, dibujantes, diseñadores, comunicadores... Sus trabajos han sido pagados por patrocinadores. También se han involucrado inversionistas, donantes y medios de comunicación nacionales e internacionales.\r(esto solo lo dice si al final el jurado le pregunta: Workana en Argentina, Escáner Cultural en Chile, Librerías Lehmann, Periódico La República, IQ Radio, Museo de los Niños, Bioland, Coca Cola, Sisso Taste of Jerusalem, Ark Mission, Cr Hoy, entre otros).\rPOTENCIAL DE CRECIMIENTO\rNoticias Mi Ciudad tiene un potencial de crecimiento tomando en cuenta un mercado de edades entre los 18 y 40 años. Sabemos que hay una gran demanda para nuestros productos, si se considera el tamaño del problema de la salud mental.\r¿Qué hemos logrado hasta el momento?\rNoticias Mi Ciudad se divide en dos etapas:\rLa primera etapa se cumplió en un 100% gracias a patrocinadores. Contiene las siguientes estrategias:\rCreación de página web con presencia en redes sociales. Ha habido y hay una inversión de tiempo. Se mantiene actualizada.\rProducción del libro: se contrató a una profesional colombiana para la diagramación y dibujo del mismo.\rRealización del concurso latinoamericano de literatura fantástica.\rOrganización del mini-festival \"Un lugar de Empatía y Fantasía\", con su respectivo material publicitario.\rCreación del personaje Retsé, una producción semanal de historias cortas, donde los textos combinan realidad y fantasía.\rLa segunda etapa contiene las siguientes estrategias:\rEl modelo de negocio está basado en una oferta de servicios en consultoría. Esta oferta continuará, pero vamos a levantar un equipo estable para continuar con la producción. Se iniciaría con dos ilustradores, dos escritores, un programador, un fotógrafo.\rSe rentabilizaría con la venta de servicios (como se viene haciendo) y con los ingresos publicitarios. La idea es ofrecer el contenido gratuito y que sea pagado por publicidad.\r¿Cómo lo haríamos?\rMediante un noticiero que tendría varias secciones, con temáticas que fueron elegidas por el mismo target mediante un sondeo que se realizó. Se ofrecerían noticias con fantasía.\rOrganización de eventos (dos por año).\rEditorial que difundiría y vendería obras de autores del Siglo XXI con calidad e innovación.\rAplicación interactiva.\rEL IMPACTO SOCIAL\r¿Cuál ha sido nuestro impacto social? Noticias Mi Ciudad produjo su propio libro, donde inversionistas apoyaron la impresión de 1000 copias. El libro estuvo en la Feria Internacional del Libro en el stand de Librería Lehmann y ahora se vende en las siete tiendas de esta librería. De hecho hay gente que ya lo está pidiendo en inglés y hebreo.\rObtuvimos un premio como emprendimiento en el Congreso Nacional de Innovación en la categoría de Industria Creativa y Cultural.\rCon nuestro primer mini-festival: “Un Lugar de Fantasía y Empatía” el 27 de septiembre, contamos con una asistencia aproximada de 200 personas, patrocinado por diversas empresas y respaldado por medios de comunicación.\rLa página de Facebook cuenta con aproximadamente 3000 seguidores sin inversión en publicidad, y aún sin poder contabilizar, existen testimonios de personas que se han acercado y están siendo impactadas por Noticias Mi Ciudad.\rTodo esto es solo una muestra de cómo estamos dando una respuesta a tres problemas principales de la sociedad: estrés, depresión y ansiedad.\rCon Noticias Mi Ciudad queremos que el viaje se convierta en un storyteller de la VIDA para promover VIDA como un proyecto deVIDA.\r",

        "script": "Welcome to part two of this Introduction to Sustainable Funding course. This section looks in more detail at where your money comes from, giving you some context about the wider funding environment for the voluntary sector.\n\nAll income sources are not created equal. Each type of income has characteristics that make them more appropriate to some organisations, and less so to others.\n \nIf we take contracts - there are many factors which can affect whether an organisation is able to bid. For example their size, they may not have enough staff with time to put a bid together. Or their track record, many social enterprises I have worked with have found that they were precluded from bidding for contracts because they hadn’t been delivering services for long enough.\n \nMany contracts need an organisation to have significant financial resources already, as payment won’t be given until the project is complete. This has meant that commissioners tend to favour larger organisations or those who can form collaborations.\n \nMany forms of gift fundraising need an organisation to have a strong relationship with their community or a popular ‘brand’ and strong marketing skills.\n \nThese different characteristics mean that whilst looking at trends can be useful, you need to be aware of hidden variation.\n \nWe’re now going to look at some of the main characteristics and trends of each different type of income\n \nGifts are great as they normally give you unrestricted income however they can be unpredictable. You can’t always plan on someone making a large donation or leaving you a bequest. There are lots of different types of donor and ways to give but it takes time build up a strong donor base.\n \nLet’s now look at trends in giving, and what you need to think about if you want to increase your income in this area.\n \nFirstly we are a nation of givers both in time and money. 65% per cent of adults donated to charitable causes in 2014. Levels of giving by individuals have remained more or less stable over the past 4 years.\n \nPeople are most likely to give to causes that support medical research or children \u0026 young people. Other popular causes are overseas aid and hospitals. Health and cultural organisations also provide a strong pull. Donors give to causes that are close to their hearts  and causes that they believe it.\n\nBuying charity merchandise is the most popular method of giving with 50% saying they give to charities this way but this was closely followed by cash with 49% of all donors who gave gave in cash. Women are most likely to give money.\n \nLegacies and bequests are an important source of income but still only 7 per cent of people in Australia leave a charitable gift in their will. So this is an untapped market as many people are not aware of the option to leave a gift when they write their will. Don’t be afraid to ask, especially from donors that you know well. As a guide the size of the bequest market in the UK is £2 billion a year or $3.5 billion which is greater than the entire fundraising efforts of Australia combined.\n \nIf you want to increase gifts you will need to think about donor motivation and why someone would want to give to your cause. This can help you to start thinking about how you could attract that type of donor.\n \nIt is advisable to offer your donors as many different methods to give as possible however the trends show us that different donor groups can favour different methods of giving. For example online donations are increasing and are favoured by both those aged 25 to 44 and the over 60’s. New research from shows us that there is a real increase in online giving and more is given online than face to face.\n\nNow let’s look at Grants.\n\nA grant is often restricted income which means that the funder has put conditions on what the money is spent on. There is normally a formal (and competitive) application process and the funder has outcomes of their own that they want to be met. Funders will require you to submit monitoring information, to show how you’ve spent the grant. Unspent funds may have to be returned to funder but this is often negotiable. You will normally have a grant agreement, terms and conditions or even a contract\n \nWe think grants are really important for the voluntary sector, and there are still plenty of grant programmes out there. There’s no doubt, though, that there is increased competition for funds. So let’s look at the other trends\n \nPublic sector grants still count for a huge proportion of the voluntary sector’s income, though it is likely that government spending cuts will continue into 2016. Many local authorities have scaled back or cut their grant programmes completely.\n \nTrusts and Foundations have also reported an increase in the number of ineligible applications and this says two things 1. many organisations are desperate for resources and 2. the scatter gun approach to grant funding doesn’t work as ineligible applications will go straight in the bin.                       \n\nSmaller trusts tend to ‘go with who they know’ – so go back to your funders and make a new proposal to them.\n \nFunders are increasingly looking for grant holders to demonstrate the social impact of their work. When done badly, this can increase the monitoring burden on voluntary organisations; however, being able to show your impact is key to attracting new funders and supporters.\n\nThere has also been an increase in more engaged grant making. Where grants are offered along with a package of support, think funders like the Impetus Trust.\n\nNow let’s look at Contracts\n \nWith contracts there is always a restriction on how money is spent. There is usually a formal (and often competitive) application or tender process. Profit can be built in to your bid or tender but you need to consider the legal and financial risks if outcomes or outputs are not delivered. GST applies in many cases, depending on the type of services.\n \nThe proportion of voluntary sector income from statutory contracts has more than doubled in last 10 years (but with huge variations across the sector). This is in part due to government channelling more funding through a procurement model than a grant model, but also because the sector is gaining experience in winning and delivering contracts.\n \nThe ‘Opening up public services’ and payment by results agendas are likely to affect organisations involved in delivering contracts in the future\n\n Payment by Results is the practice of paying providers for delivering services after agreed results have been achieved.\n\nIt intends to reward performance, or outcomes, instead of activity, or outputs. It staggers spending and risk between the funder and the provider. If you are not sure what is meant by the terms outcomes and outputs we explain those terms in more depth in part three.\n \nSo there is a positive motive, but the current reality is that there is a lack of efficiency and transparency, and Payment By Results can be very difficult for organisations that don’t have the resources to deliver before payment.\n\nFinally, we need to think about Consortia and sub-contracting.\n\nBigger contracts and demand for partnership working increase the need to work together. Consortia and sub-contracting can provide great opportunities to pool skills and resources, but can also be complex and costly to set up, and you need to be careful about allocation of risk.\n\n So lastly, Trading.\n \nTrading provides unrestricted income. It involves a customer transaction, and customers may not be the same people as your beneficiaries.\n\nSomething else to note is that you may need to change your legal structure to allow your organisation to trade. Remember that income above certain amount is taxable.\n\nSo what are the trends in trading to watch for?\n \nWe’ve seen a recent growth in ethical consumerism, as well as a growth in finance providers specialising in supporting social enterprise.\n\n The term ‘Social enterprise’ is increasingly recognised by Government as an important activity in delivering public services.\n \nThere’s also more public awareness of trading for social benefits, with initiatives like Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant appearing on mainstream television.\n\nIn additional to these four types of income, we’re seeing an increased interest in social investment models, where private finance is used to fund a social and financial return.\n \nYou may have heard of the ‘Social Impact Bond’, where central government or a social business uses investment from private investors to fund voluntary sector organisations to deliver social outcomes. For example the first UK scheme, launched in 2010 was based on prisoner re-offending rates.\n \nIf the outcomes are met, government pays back the investors with interest. It is a way of raising capital when it’s needed, and is a form of payment by results. At the moment there are only a few trials with large organisations. However, there are lots of other forms of social investment, such as small loans to help you bridge a funding gap, or overdrafts to help cash flow when you have a large one-off payment to make.\n \nSo, where do you fit?\n\nLook at the income spectrum exercise from the first part of this training. Bearing in mind the general picture across the sector, how do you feel about the long-term stability of your income? Do you think you have a strong enough mix of income? Or are you reliant on one type?\n\nWe have an exercise for you to download below, that will help you assess where your organisation’s income sits at the moment, and where your risks lie.\n \nIn the final video of this course, we’ll be explaining some key terms and concepts for sustainable funding and exploring how you can assess your organisation’s financial sustainability.\n \n\nThank you.",

        "script": "Welcome to part three of the Introduction to Sustainable Funding course. This section looks in more detail at how you can improve your organisation’s overall financial health. In particular we’ll be looking at the six areas of sustainability, the sun tool which helps you map how you’re doing across them. We’ll also cover some key terminology and concepts that are crucial for you to understand and use, thinking about your assets and then looking at how you can pull this together into a useful planning process. Finally we’ll suggest some next steps.\n\n \nFor this part of the course, you will need the ‘Sustainable Sun Tool’, which you can download below. Pause this if you’d like to print out the download now but don’t worry if you don’t have a printer to hand, I’ll talk you through how to use the tool and you can always print it later.\n\n\nSo, looking at the Sun Tool, the first thing to notice is that income is actually only just one aspect. Our argument is that no organisation can be sustainable unless fundraising and income generation is supported by other areas. So, for instance, if you have trouble with financial management, you may not be able to provide the information needed to support a funding application, or you’ll have trouble managing the financial procedures once you’ve been successful.\n\n\nTo fill out the Sun tool you choose one option from each of the six areas that sounds most like your organisation. You then plot that on the sun – the closer to the middle, the better you’re doing. Then join the dots to make a probably somewhat wonky circle.\n\n\nPause this here if you’d like to do this now.\n\n\nSo, how does it look? Is there one area that stands out as needing some urgent work?\n\n\nYou may next want to ask different people within your organisation to complete this tool on their own. Then compare the results. It will be interesting to see where opinions differ and explore why this is. Why don’t you print out a few copies for your next planning day or trustee meeting?\n\nSo now we’ll look at some key terms you may come across when looking at income holistically. It is important to understand these, not just because you might hear others using them – particularly funders – but because they contribute to sustainability.\n\n \nThe first is Full Cost Recovery.\n\n \nThere are lots of different tools available to help you to work out full cost recovery, but the most important thing is to understand what it means and be aware of how it is reflected in your income generating and planning.\n\n \nFull Cost Recovery is a process by which organisations make sure that they are raising the real amount they need to cover the costs of their activities. All too often costs can be ‘hidden’ and therefore not budgeted for and not included in fundraising. For instance, even volunteers are likely to have costs attached to them – they’ll need some sort of management, they might use your building or your stationary and computers. And what would happen if a key volunteer couldn’t help you any more? What would it cost to get this help elsewhere?\n\n \nSo, when you’re budgeting, you’ll need to work out how to allocate a proportion of the relevant costs to volunteers and find out their real cost. Then you need to work out how to raise this money. Perhaps you have decided to pay for it from surplus from elsewhere. Or perhaps you can fundraise for them.\n\nLet’s think about some other hidden costs.\n\nA project giving support and advice to young people might have some obvious direct costs – staff time working with the young people, the cost of the venue you’ll be using, maybe paying travel expenses. But there will also be a proportion of lots of other costs – management of the project, of the staff involved and the organisation in general, administrative support, insurance and utility bills. Without deciding how much of these this project is using, you don’t know its full cost. This means that you possibly won’t be raising enough money but also that you might not make the right strategic decisions about which projects are the best use of your organisation’s resources. After all, you want to be achieving the most with the resources that you have.\n\n \nYou might want to set up a spreadsheet to work this out – so, for instance, you could enter how much time a project spends in the building, and it could apportion building related costs accordingly. You might want to think about how this varies over time. New projects will always take more management time – and probably more admin too, whereas projects that are coming to the end of a grant will require more fundraising, evaluation and possibly reporting.\n\n \nWhen you add up all the costs your organisation occurs, you should then be able to see which project is using what.\n\n \nThe next key terms, Outputs, Outcomes and Impact, you’ve probably heard of, but it’s amazing how many people don’t really understand what they mean, or don’t remember to make them clear. I’ve marked applications from organisation of different sizes and experience, and the mistake is all too common.\n \n\nOutputs are the things you actually do. So you might deliver a training course, or talk to 20 people, or produce an art work. Outputs are usually tangible and can easily be evidenced. These are the easy things to record.\n\n\nOutcomes are trickier. They are the things that happened as a result of your outputs. So, you talked to 20 people and as a result, they understood how they could recycle more. How do you demonstrate that they understood? You produce and art work that communicates to visitors to your local shopping centre some of the emotions felt by teenagers. \n\n\nSo what? That’s your impact – your outputs result in outcomes that lead to a change, an impact – the difference you’ve made to people’s lives or the wider world. Sometimes funding applications only ask for outcomes – they almost always mean impact too. And you should be able to provide some evidence – even if it is ‘soft’ evidence of a case study or a quote. If four of the people on your training course went on to use their new skills to get jobs (the outcome) then so what? Well for one participant, this had the impact that he was able to move to a secure home with his family and his son, Jonny, has been able to settle in at school.\n\n \nIt can help to get someone else to check that you are really demonstrating your impact, not just stating your outputs or outcomes. And you should be able to communicate it to anyone, via any media.\n\nTo help you to check whether you’re clear on the differences between Outputs, Outcomes and Impact, I’ve written a mini-quiz you can download below.\n\n \nSo, moving on, another key piece of terminology is Asset. Assets are, in this case, economic resources. They are things that could be converted into a financial value. Often, organisations have assets that are ‘hidden’. For instance, you may have a building that you are not realising the full value of (how about renting out some space, or even installing solar panels).\n \n\nIt could be that your staff or volunteers are hidden assets – could their skills be used to generate income? Or maybe some of your activities could have a double life, producing spin-off publications or training courses?\n \n\nThis diagram helps you to think about where your resources lie.\n\n \nThis is taken from an excellent report by Caroline Beaumont developed through the Clore Social Leadership programme.\n\n \nIf you think back to part one when we thought about income streams, we were talking about how different types of income fit with your organisation. This helps you to look at your organisation in more detail. Think about getting the right income - what you actually need funding for, and what you already have, or could access in kind.\n\n \nGoing back to the three Ss – understanding what is suitable is about understanding what you actually need money for, and what you don’t.\n \n\nIt’s also about understanding how changing the way you generate income might fit with the culture of your organisation. What steps do you need to take to make it work, to ensure your staff and volunteers are happy with a new approach. If you want to take this exercise a step further, you can download it below.\n\n \nFinally, don’t forget to build in proper planning. Sustainable funding isn’t something that is a discrete activity you can do on your own, or as a one-off. You need to evaluate your mission, build a suitable strategy, craft an achievable plan from that and build in regular reviews. Do you need trigger points for action? (for instance, should certain things have happened by a specific time, or a certain amount of money have been secured?) This planning cycle gives you an example of the types of steps you ought to be taking, but in a way it’s deceptive – you need to be revisiting all the steps regularly.\n \n\nSo, this is the end of our Introduction to Sustainable Funding mini-course. What do you need to do now?\n \n\nDecide what your most urgent action needs to be – perhaps the sun tool or the income spectrum could help you.\n\n \nCheck the materials you already have – are you communicating your Outputs, Outcomes and Impact clearly? Are you able to justify your costs if asked?\n\n \nWork out any ‘gaps’ in your knowledge, skills or systems that could hold you back.\n\n\nMake sure you can keep up momentum – it’s very easy to lose sight of your goals when your workload is heavy. Perhaps signing up to our newsletter, booking into a more advanced course or arranging a meeting with relevant people could help.\n \n\nSo, in this Introduction to Sustainable Funding course we’ve covered the ‘income spectrum’ – looking beyond raising money from just one source to thinking wider to all potential sources of funding – gifts and donations, grants, contracts, trading and loan finance or social investment. We’ve taken you through some of the features of each of these and the current trends they are experiencing. And then in this section we’ve placed funding in a wider context, showing you a way you can assess how sustainable your organisation is and explaining some key terms you will need to learn.\n \n\nTake a look at the AYMN website for all our sustainable funding tools and resources. Now you’ve completed this introductory course, it might be that you want to take Sustainable Funding further with one of our more advanced. Or, if you think you need more bespoke or in-depth support, then perhaps consultancy would be more suitable. Again, you can find all our resources, including information about AYMN consultancy, on our website. Many of the tools we use in our training courses are free to download too. I hope you’ve found this course helpful. If you take away only two things please remember, 1. Being sustainable is about resource-raising, not fundraising and 2. Sustainable funding can only be successful when integrated and understood by your whole organisation – it is a team activity.\n\n \n\nThank you",

Sometimes funding applications only ask for outcomes – they almost always mean impact too. And you should be able to provide some evidence – even if it is ‘soft’ evidence of a case study or a quote. If four of the people on your training course went on to use their new skills to get jobs (the outcome) then so what? Well for one participant, this had the impact that he was able to move to a secure home with his family and his son, Jonny, has been able to settle in at school.\n\n \n\nIt can help to get someone else to check that you are really demonstrating your impact, not just stating your outputs or outcomes. And you should be able to communicate it to anyone, via any media.\n\nTo help you to check whether you’re clear on the differences between Outputs, Outcomes and Impact, I’ve written a mini-quiz you can download below.\n\n \n\nSo, moving on, another key piece of terminology is Asset. Assets are, in this case, economic resources. They are things that could be converted into a financial value. Often, organisations have assets that are ‘hidden’. For instance, you may have a building that you are not realising the full value of (how about renting out some space, or even installing solar panels).\n\n \n\nIt could be that your staff or volunteers are hidden assets – could their skills be used to generate income? Or maybe some of your activities could have a double life, producing spin-off publications or training courses?\n\n \n\nThis diagram helps you to think about where your resources lie.\n\n \n\nThis is taken from an excellent report by Caroline Beaumont developed through the Clore Social Leadership programme.\n\n \n\nIf you think back to part one when we thought about income streams, we were talking about how different types of income fit with your organisation. This helps you to look at your organisation in more detail. Think about getting the right income - what you actually need funding for, and what you already have, or could access in kind.\n\n \n\nGoing back to the three Ss – understanding what is suitable is about understanding what you actually need money for, and what you don’t.\n\n \n\nIt’s also about understanding how changing the way you generate income might fit with the culture of your organisation. What steps do you need to take to make it work, to ensure your staff and volunteers are happy with a new approach. If you want to take this exercise a step further, you can download it below.\n\n \n\nFinally, don’t forget to build in proper planning. Sustainable funding isn’t something that is a discrete activity you can do on your own, or as a one-off. You need to evaluate your mission, build a suitable strategy, craft an achievable plan from that and build in regular reviews. Do you need trigger points for action? (for instance, should certain things have happened by a specific time, or a certain amount of money have been secured?) This planning cycle gives you an example of the types of steps you ought to be taking, but in a way it’s deceptive – you need to be revisiting all the steps regularly.\n\n \n\nSo, this is the end of our Introduction to Sustainable Funding mini-course. What do you need to do now?\n\n \n\nDecide what your most urgent action needs to be – perhaps the sun tool or the income spectrum could help you.\n\n \n\nCheck the materials you already have – are you communicating your Outputs, Outcomes and Impact clearly? Are you able to justify your costs if asked?\n\n \n\nWork out any ‘gaps’ in your knowledge, skills or systems that could hold you back.\n\n \n\nMake sure you can keep up momentum – it’s very easy to lose sight of your goals when your workload is heavy. Perhaps signing up to our newsletter, booking into a more advanced course or arranging a meeting with relevant people could help.\n\n \n\nSo, in this Introduction to Sustainable Funding course we’ve covered the ‘income spectrum’ – looking beyond raising money from just one source to thinking wider to all potential sources of funding – gifts and donations, grants, contracts, trading and loan finance or social investment. We’ve taken you through some of the features of each of these and the current trends they are experiencing. And then in this section we’ve placed funding in a wider context, showing you a way you can assess how sustainable your organisation is and explaining some key terms you will need to learn.\n\n \n\nTake a look at the AYMN website for all our sustainable funding tools and resources. Now you’ve completed this introductory course, it might be that you want to take Sustainable Funding further and if you think you need more bespoke or in-depth support, then perhaps consultancy would be more suitable. Again, you can find all our resources, including information about AYMN consultancy, on our website. Many of the tools we use in our training courses are free to download too. I hope you’ve found this course helpful. If you take away only two things please remember, 1. Being sustainable is about resource-raising, not fundraising and 2. Sustainable funding can only be successful when integrated and understood by your whole organisation – it is a team activity.\n\n \n\nThank you",

In the event of a large loss you may bei nclined to think you need a large company to manage our claim. A company with many departments. I have worked with the largest firms and it might be a good idea to engage a large firm if you have twenty homes in a catastrophic area so you only need call one number, but that is the only reason. Large firms compress their adjusters, school them in house,  so no one else in the business scoops them up, employs them. I know, I was one of them, but when I was hired I had already received the best achademics possible, and after I shared my knowledge enough times, correcting the in house educators and president they were ready for a change.  I am clear, the best way to represent anothers interests is to be shore you have the right skill set.  Trust me, there is always some one smarter and in our business if you blink too often the case law changes and the probability of case law changing is real.  What stays the same is the methodology and we have found when you find a system that works, work that system until there are enough reasons to change it.

Network Transparency\nMomentum can provide Network Transpre if w we even place our SLAs next to the statistics on the report and if we do not meet them a credit will be issued.\n4. Support and Implementation \nBefore a contract is even signed a Momentum Sales Engineer will go and conduct a site survey. The same engineer will then go back on-site to complete the install and also to take time training the customer on how to use our portal and assist them in how they want their phones and calls setup. No \"plug and pray\" methodology like other VOIP companies! We also have 24/7/365 Customer Support that is averaging under 30 seconds in calls answered!\n\nAre you ready to feel the MOMENTM DIFFERENCE!?\nLet's have lunch next week and discuss.\nncy reports at any time due to our proprietary probes that we have placed throughout the call path.",

We have accomplished a few milestones this year but more importantly, have overcome many of the “start up” challenges that put us on the top 7% (start ups that get to revenue) and beyond.\nI would like to offer my place as the location since it is one of the most centralized locations considering everybody’s home address. \n\nPlease shoot me a quick note with your availability for an after 5pm get together after December 14th. You are welcome to stay as long as you want but I hope you agree with me when I say: “ A Team Toast is a must!”\n\nCould you please respond to me only with three available dates so I can schedule accordingly?\n\nThanks and have a good day!\n",

        "script": "Hello fellow not-for-profiteers, my name is Bradley Grieve and I’m the CEO of the Australian Youth Mentoring Network and I’m here to welcome you to the first of three instalments of this short course on sustainable funding.\n\nSustainable funding for many of us is, well, at the same odds of winning the lottery. However, unlike winning the lottery, sustainable funding is a perfectly achievable goal and quite the admirable one too. The reason why sustainable funding seems so distant to many not-for-profits is because of the simple fact that we simply don’t set out with it in mind. We don’t plan for it. We’re too busy focusing on helping others to be bothered to help ourselves. Therefore, and please don’t let the irony be lost on you here, it is the altruistic nature of our sector that is very often hampering our long term objectives of helping others. So this short course is set to help you, and the causes that you set out to address, out of that spiralling hole of unsustainability. So here we go.\n\nThis course is conveniently packaged in three parts for easy digestion. In Part one will look at where the money comes from, and as your parents repeatedly told you, it’s not from trees. In Part 2 we will look at the trends of each the income streams, and thirdly we’ll look at the seven habits of highly sustainable programs.\n\nSo, let’s not waffle any further, let’s get to it. In this section I’ll do my best to show you the money, but first we need to have a quick chat about the three laws of sustainable funding which are as easy as ABC. In order for funding to be sustainable it must be Appropriate, Balance and Complete.\n\nAppropriateness of funding, relates to the fact that there is no point in having an ample supply of money if it can’t be spent on the projects or the people you’re looking to help. Now, as unbelievable as it may seem, it is true that some rich people are unhappy, and the same applies to projects who accept funding that is inappropriate for them. Often projects accept funding but in order to access it they have to change their vision or mission only to later end up feeling that they have lost their way and compromised their values. So it is important to understand that each organisation is different and needs to find the most appropriate funding for them.\n\nBalanced: This simply means having a wide range of funding sources so your organisation can smooth out the ups and downs\n\nComplete: By having a complete idea of what your real spending is, you can raise enough income to cover your costs.\n\nSo, with the basic understanding of the laws of sustainability, we can now turn our attention to where the money comes from. And here, in a break from tradition, there are four streams of income where going to look at, Donations, Grants, Contracts and Trading.\n\nWe’ll start with Donations.\n\nDonations are made by individuals typically for charitable purposes or to benefit a cause, or sometimes simply for a tax deduction. And donations take various forms including gifts of cash, services, new or used goods including clothing, toys, food, and vehicles. However, more often than not it is cash that people give, and women give more than men.  Come on guys, lift your game.\n\nSecond is Grants. By grants we mean restricted funding to deliver specific work, often received after an application process. Grants are good, but they can be addictive and are increasingly hard to come by.\n\nThe next income stream is Contracts. These usually involve payment for provision of products or services according to agreed terms. Contracts are often between not-for-profit organisations and public bodies such as Governments or local councils.\n\nAnd finally, we have trading, this means selling products or services to customers. Trading can include providing services or advice for a fee, or selling a product like a book. There is no difference here between a for-profit business and a charity. For all the casual customer knows, it’s just another snappy business selling the latest and greatest fandangles.\n\nSo, those are the four main income streams and we’ll explore these in more detail in Part 2.\n\nBut there are also some other things to consider alongside the income streams.\n\nWhether income is from a donor or a customer can sometimes be a tricky question. It all depends on whether the person who gave the gift is considered to be getting something other warm and fuzzy feelings in exchange for their money. If they are, they are a customer, if not, they are a donor. And this of course can affect tax deductibility for our kindly patrons so you’d better get it right or beware the screaming banshee that is the Tax Man.\n\nFor some very lucky organisations there is also stuff called investment income. Investment income includes rent from property, dividends and interest on deposits. For most of us, investment income is as rare as a unicorn with hen’s teeth riding a magic carpet, as it represents such a small share of overall income, but for some organisations it is very important.\n\nNow that we’ve found where money comes from, and that really is the easy bit, what happens next? Well, knowledge is only power if it takes the form of action so we’ll look at the steps you need to take.\n\nYour first priority should be to take a look at your organisation to see where you fit. Ask yourself which of the four streams is your biggest source of income. Then see if you can put a figure on each of the four categories, working out the percentage in each income stream. Finally, work out how many different sources of income are within that income stream, for example you may have 100 individual donors or five different grants coming into your organisation.\n\nYou might want to pause the video at this point and work out your biggest source of income, how much of your income is in each stream, and how many contributors you have in each of the four streams.\n\nOnce you have answered these questions, you can start to see if your income mix is risky. For example, if all your money is coming from one stream then you may be over-dependent on that type of income. Also, if your income streams are all ending soon this is another risk factor.\n\nSo what happens if after the exercise you find that you are extraordinarily focused on a narrow stream of income, what are you supposed to do to go about diversifying your income?\n\nThere are different ways that you could diversify. One is to spread out across the income spectrum. By developing new income in different streams you can spread your risk. For example you can diversify away from grant dependence by developing your donor base, bringing in much more gift income. You can get cracking straight away with community fundraising activities and developing relationships with potential donors. Another way that you could diversify your income is by bringing in more from existing income streams. For example, you could use a funding search website to start exploring new grant and contract opportunities for your organisation.\n\nThe vital thing to remember about diversifying is that there is no magic formula for your organisation’s income. You could have a mix across all the income streams, or you could specialise in one of the four types of income. The trick here is to not narrow your options, rather just get out there and play the funding field.\n\nBut remember that money is just one piece of the puzzle. Other important factors include your organisation’s mission, vision and values, keeping those at the centre of the work you do. Also, you will need to have the right people in place to do your fundraising and income generation. Have you got the right skills already or do you need to invest in training or get in specialist advice?\n\nFinally, measuring and reporting your impact is getting more and more important to show to funders and supporters that you are achieving real change in the world.\n\nSo Sustainable Funding is about planning– considering all the different sources of income, plus the context and environment that your work in. Remember the ABCs - and look for income that is Appropriate, Balanced, and Complete.\n\nIn this section of the course we have covered the ABCs of the sustainable funding approach and the four main income streams, Donations, Grants, Contracts and Trading.\n\nSo that’s your lot of the this section so I hope you’ll join us in the next part of the course where we’ll be exploring the characteristics of different income streams and current trends.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ",

        "script": "Momentum Telecom is very interested in discussing a Strategic Partnership with *********. I was directed to you by an esteemed colleague Matt Sharp as the best POC for new Carrier/ Provider relationships.\n\n I don’t want to overwhelm you with too much company information in this initial correspondence, but I do want to mention that Momentum offers a pre-sale site survey and we conduct on-site implantation and training, at no cost to the customer or Partner. \nMomentum has been in the VOiP marketplace for over a decade and are probably the largest VOiP provider you haven’t heard of. \nOur network is state of the art and geo-redundant and we even offer Network Transparency Reports with our SLAs listed next to the specified statistics on the report, and if we did not meet our SLAs a credit is issued with the report.\n\nI have identified ******* as a candidate for our current opening in our elite Master Partner Program and would like to schedule a discovery meeting to discuss if our companies align appropriately and identify if a mutually beneficial partnership is possible between Momentum Telecom and your organization.\n \nShould we decide that our relationship is not best suited for our elite Master Partner Program, at least we have the opportunity to meet and discuss the current telecom landscape and expand our own professional networks.\n\n I am very aware of how saturated the VOiP market is. I bet you get a high volume of Channel Managers, like myself, reaching out to you constantly wanting to discuss their Partner Program. \n\nWill your schedule permit a 30minute introductory call next Wednesday?\n\nLooking forward to speaking with you and have a great day.",

        "script": "Hello.\n\nI’m Paul Peck.\n\nI’m going to share with you a few images that help explain my background.\n\nOver the course of my career, I’ve been hired a dozen times.\nAnd I helped 6 of those companies through a merger acquisition process.\nLater in my career, I went into consulting, for 8 more firms.\n\nHere is the run-down on my unusually diverse background.  \n\nI went to Texas Tech University.  I joined Texas Instruments a year before I graduated.\nIn my senior year, I was simultaneously a full time student and a full time employee.  I helped TI launch Calculators, Watches, and the famous Speak and Spell text-to speech processing learning aid.  I graduated on time, and stayed at TI long enough for them to pay for my MBA.\n\nAfter TI, I moved back to my hometown, Fort Worth, and joined General Dynamics\nI ran materials management programs, and worked on the start-up of the F-16 program, as well as special projects for NASA.\n\nI was recruited by ex-TIers to join DanRay, one of the first companies in the Telecom Corridor.\nAt DanRay, I became Materials Manager and Industrial Engineering Manager - simultaneously.\nThat company made the very first switching systems for MCI and Sprint, and was later bought by Nortel\n\nAfter Nortel, I became a business systems consultant for Xerox Computer Services.  I specialized in Sales support and system implementation.\nAt XCS, we had one of the first cloud-computing ERP systems, and we introduced the world’s first desktop computers that had GUI screens and a mouse.\n\nI was hired by an XCS client to run their operations, and ultimately became the general manager of the business.\nI managed that company through an acquisition, the licensing of their technology, and the ultimate sale to Davox Corporation.\nAfter Davox the licensee hired me to run a new business unit where we pioneered automated operator services.\n\nDuring this time I pursued an old dream - to become an expert in accounting and get a CPA license.  I took the additional courses I needed at UT-Dallas and passed all 5 sections of the 3 day exam on the first try.  Then, I was finally prepared for dealing with all those corporate bean counters who wanted to tell me what the “rules” are.\n\nI was recruited by DSC Communications, helped the company divisionalize, ran one of the 1st divisions, and ultimately became VP of global manufacturing, with over 1,800 people and shipping nearly $2 billion a year, or as I like to say, $1 million an hour.  At DSC I helped us buy and run the TI business unit that invented text-to-speech processing.  ET phoned home, from my point of view.  Later I became DSC’s GM for the Japan business unit, where my development team introduced automated roaming and the worlds first wireless texting system.  DSC was bought by Alcatel, where I remained as their VP of the Asian business unit. for a while.\n\nI left Alcatel to join the start-up Monterey Networks as VP of Manufacturing.  At Monterey, we designed and built the world’s largest optical router, and in less that 16 months, we took Monterey from a $10 million A-Round to a $550 million exit when we were purchased by Cisco Systems.  I stayed with Cisco for another 18 months, vesting bur nor resting - I helped Cisco developing a product launch process for the telecom service provider segment that were just entering.  After Cisco, I joined another stat-up that was ultimately acquired by Cisco, Navini Networks, makers of some of the most advanced wireless systems outside the military.\n\nAfter Navini, I joined Covaro Networks as VP of Operations.  We developed telecom solutions that extended high-speed Ethernet to the end user.  Covaro was bought by ADVA Optical Networking of Germany, where I became BOTH Global VP of Quality Management AND VP of Strategic Materials Management AND integration executive for the purchase of Movaz Networks - again- simultaneously.  I left ADVA to join a supplier, Menara Networks, as Chief Financial Officer.  I helped the maker of miniaturized long-haul optical devices set up their accounting process, and heir outsourced materials and manufacturing process.\n\nI left Menara to take on a series of lucrative consulting engagements, by specializing in engineering systems, product launch, and business systems.  One of these companies was Global Supply Chain Solutions, where I helped manage through a business restructuring and acquisition.  The new owners asked me to become interim CEO for their 1st 2 years of ownership.\n\nOther companies for which I’ve been a consultant include pioneers in mass storage, digital wallet, industrialized tablets, high-performance computing, long-haul microwave, and LED lighting.  One client was the top recipient from the Texas Emerging Technology Fund, and another was a Shark-Tank investment recipient, by Mark Cuban, no less, on my watch as their contract CFO.\n\nAnother client, 70-year-old Weathermatic, asked me to become their first combination COO/CFO.  At Weathermatic, I completed the implementation of their cloud-based ERP system, put in on-line budgeting, on-line purchasing, and on-line expense reimbursement.  We also engaged a new audit firm and new legal counsel, and upgraded those processes as well.  And perhaps best - a 2 day financial close process.\n\nI have extensive international experience, having held executive positions with several multi-national companies, and have had either customers, operations or key suppliers all over the world.  I am quite comfortable with setting up global supply and value-add chains on an international basis.  I’m one of those guys that has had to get extra pages put in his passport before it expires.\n\nSo there you have it - I’ve worn just about every kind of hat there is to wear, in all sorts of situations, for all kinds of companies.  And I’m proud to say that I am a survivor of every event where my company was purchased.  That’s not likely unless you know how to make the trains run on time.\nAs you can imagine, as a result of all this, I have quite a bit of experience in target acquisition, due diligence, and acquisition integration.\n\nI’m very active in the community.  At the local level, I’m vice chair and treasurer of the largest economic development trade organization in Texas. I’m on the Mayor’s task force for International Business, and on the City’s tax increment financing board.  I’m on two boards at the University of Texas at Dallas and frequent guest lecturer.  I’ll do just about anything to advance the cause of investment, economic development and education.\n\nPersonally, I have a few hobbies - My wife and I are extreme sightseeing travelers, and I’m a vintage technology collector.  \n\nI have to confess to being a car guy.  One of my favorite pastimes is amateur motorsports, and I am quite the track-school enthusiast.  I’m not that good, but I did manage to win a 1st place trophy from the BMW International Driving School at the Nurburgring in Germany.  \n\nMy wife is a realtor-broker, and together, we are not only real estate property owners, but also real estate developers.  We live in a small subdivision we developed, on a street we named.\n\nIf you need help in any of the following areas, which comprise just about very area there is in most technology businesses, please let me know.  If I can’t help you, I bet I can help you find someone that can.\n\nThanks for taking time to hear my story, and to consider how I might be able to help you.\n\n\n\n\nBye bye.",

As you are noticing I am trying out a new tool that allows me to speak to you directly via this video.  This tool is new to the market and is called iTOi, which is the brainchild of my good friends. So I offered to give it a test drive.  More on this later.  For now, let us start with this DIY plate collection we made. It's fun and easy.  It is the perfect way to make your tablescape vision a reality for a low cost.\n\nWe bought these white plates from target.  They have a fabulous selection of all white china with different shapes to chose from.\n\nWe then used the Pebeo Porcelaine 150 pen, which allows you to pain on ceramic.  We bought ours at amazon.com and they come in all kids of colors.  Here we used the lapis color.\n\nWe chose a blue and white theme for our table, so decided to look for some pretty blue and white inspiration on pinterest and found plenty of chinoiserie style plates and other european blue and white designs.  We wanted to chose something simple as we were jsut trying this out for the first time.  HInt- buy more plates than you actually need so you can play around with the pens and make sure you understand how they work.\n\nAfter we painted our desired designs we let them dry for 24 hours and then we put them in the oven at 300 for 35 minutes.  This will set the paint and it becomes dishwasher safe for all future use.\n\nAfter they are done then its all about setting your beautiful table. The fun part , as I like to call it. We made these for our friend holiday gift exchange and so we wanted to incorporate some feminine pinks into the mix.  And seeing as though I had spotted some pretty peonies at the market new I wanted to have these for my centerpiece. \n\nI grabbed some rosemary from my garden. These sure grow well here in Texas and even fend off mosquitoes. Plus theya re so easy to take care of.  I grabbed some bunches, tied them to some candy cane ornaments with pink ribbon to add that holiday sparkle for each pla\n\n",

        "script": "The Story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\n\nGrimm's Fairy Tale version - translated by Margaret Hunt - language modernized a bit by Leanne Guenther\n\n\nOnce upon a time, long, long ago a king and queen ruled over a distant land.  The queen was kind and lovely and all the people of the realm adored her.  The only sadness in the queen's life was that she wished for a child but did not have one. \n\nOne winter day, the queen was doing needle work while gazing out her ebony window at the new fallen snow.  A bird flew by the window startling the queen and she pricked her finger.  A single drop of blood fell on the snow outside her window.  As she looked at the blood on the snow she said to herself, \"Oh, how I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony.\"  \n\nSoon after that, the kind queen got her wish when she gave birth to a baby girl who had skin white as snow, lips red as blood, and hair black as ebony.  They named the baby princess Snow White, but sadly, the queen died after giving birth to Snow White.\n\nSoon after, the king married a new woman who was beautiful, but as well proud and cruel.  She had studied dark magic and owned a magic mirror, of which she would daily ask, \n\nMirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?\n\nEach time this question was asked, the mirror would give the same answer, \"Thou, O Queen, art the fairest of all.\"  This pleased the queen greatly as she knew that her magical mirror could speak nothing but the truth.\n\nOne morning when the queen asked, \"Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?\" she was shocked when it answered:\n\nYou, my queen, are fair; it is true.\nBut Snow White is even fairer than you.\nThe Queen flew into a jealous rage and ordered her huntsman to take Snow White into the woods to be killed.  She demanded that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart as proof. \n\nThe poor huntsman took Snow White into the forest, but found himself unable to kill the girl.  Instead, he let her go, and brought the queen the heart of a wild boar.\n\nSnow White was now all alone in the great forest, and she did not know what to do.  The trees seemed to whisper to each other, scaring Snow White who began to run.  She ran over sharp stones and through thorns.  She ran as far as her feet could carry her, and just as evening was about to fall she saw a little house and went inside in order to rest.\n\nInside the house everything was small but tidy.  There was a little table with a tidy, white tablecloth and seven little plates.  Against the wall there were seven little beds, all in a row and covered with quilts.\n\nBecause she was so hungry Snow White ate a few vegetables and a little bread from each little plate and from each cup she drank a bit of milk. Afterward, because she was so tired, she lay down on one of the little beds and fell fast asleep.\n\nAfter dark, the owners of the house returned home.  They were the seven dwarves who mined for gold in the mountains.  As soon as they arrived home, they saw that someone had been there -- for not everything was in the same order as they had left it.\n\nThe first one said, \"Who has been sitting in my chair?\"\n\nThe second one, \"Who has been eating from my plate?\"\n\nThe third one, \"Who has been eating my bread?\"\n\nThe fourth one, \"Who has been eating my vegetables?\"\n\nThe fifth one, \"Who has been eating with my fork?\"\n\nThe sixth one, \"Who has been drinking from my cup?\"\n\n",

        "script": "Hi.  My name is Kevin Greene.  Thanks for participating in Winning the Negotiating Game!  I hope you enjoyed it, and that you’ll use what you learned to negotiate your way to greater overall success both personally and professionally.\n\nAs a thank you for attending, I have a few special offers I’d like to extend just for you.\n\nFirst is an incentive to attend our Breakthrough Negotiating 8-week online course.  Although you wouldn’t have realized it, you’ve completed the first two modules already.  We gave them to you for free so you could experience the learning for yourself first hand.\n\nPlaying the Negotiating Game was Module 1 of that 8-week course, and this webinar, Winning the Negotiating Game was Module 2.  \n\nIn Modules 3-8, we reveal the strategies and tools you’ll need to negotiate better deals, stronger relationships, and mutual gains at work, and in your personal life.\n\nYou can learn more about the 8-week Breakthrough Negotiating online course by following the “learn more” link here on this page.  I trust you’ll find it a very worthwhile investment.\n\nThe investment for the course is $1,497.  But if you register right now, as a thank you for attending this webinar, I’ll reduce the price by $500 to only $997.  Further, I’ll include complimentary access to my new advanced negotiating program, Breakthrough Negotiating II:  Game Changing Strategies.  \n\nWhereas the Breakthrough Negotiating program focuses on skills you can employ to negotiate successfully at the table, Breakthrough Negotiating II focuses on strategies you can employ away from the table to set the table before you sit at the table and win the game before the game even begins.\n\nRegistration for this course is also $1,497, but you’ll get it for free if you register now.  I’ll also throw in a customized certificate of completion for each course upon conclusion, and a signed copy of my book, Breakthrough Negotiating.  That’s over $3,000 worth of value for $997.  If you’re serious about becoming a better negotiator, it’s a deal you can’t pass up.\n\nNow here’s the catch on this offer.  It’s a one-time offer and it’s only good for the next few minutes.  And I have to cap it at 20 participants, so once those seats are gone the offer is over.  If this webinar is like most of our webinars, those seats will be gone before I’m done talking.  So you should sign-up now if you’re interested.\n\nNow the second offer pertains to anyone interested in booking an in-house seminar.  The Breakthrough Negotiating 2-day seminar is customized to your business and presented onsite at your location to your team.  It’s a lot of fun, great for team building, and will begin showing an incredible return on your investment almost immediately after the course.\n\nIf you book now, I’ll waive my travel expenses including airfare, hotel, ground transportation, and per diem.  This is typically worth about $2,000.  If your location is close and travel expenses are less than $2,000, I’ll give you a full $2,000 credit on your seminar.  For international companies located outside of North American the credit is limited to $2,000 no matter the full cost of travel expenses.\n\nNow here’s the catch on this one.  This offer is good for 24 hours and limited to 1 company.  If you’re interested, you should contact us right away by following the instructions below.\n\nFinally, we’ll be selecting one random winner from today’s webinar who will receive an signed copy of my book, Breakthrough Negotiating.  The winner will be notified within the next 72 hours.\n\nOnce again everyone, I thank you for participating.\n\nRemember, you can do more than play the negotiating game, you can win.\n\nI look forward to seeing you in class.\n\n",

I took a screenshot of the life insurance policy you sent Hernan as an example of how you can include files for your clients. \r\n\r\nIncluding pictures takes the pressure of having your picture on the video the entire time as I demonstrate in this video.

While much of what I will address is applicable to all students, part time as well, the ones I hope hear me today are our full time students and their parents.\n \nAs I review attendance, participation, and academic achievement data, I am discovering a very real issue that affects our entire school. That issue is: what does \"going to school\" mean in a virtual setting.\n \nOne of the major benefits of being a full time DVIA student is the ability to schedule your academic work ‘around’ other activities and events in your life, regardless of what they might be. However, that cannot mean “putting off” today’s work repeatedly. In your LMS there is a progress report. You will notice the pacing or completion of your individual courses. You will see the your progress indicated by bars.\n \nIf you are near (within a couple of % points), equal to, or are ahead of the pacing, that bar becomes “blue”. This is Great!!!\n \nI point these out as a reference for you to consider when you review your status.\n\nIf you are “in the blue”, you are on pace and moving ahead according to plan. You have likely developed your academic plan and schedule and are following it appropriately. Great job!\n \nIf you are “in the red”, you have a need to review your current schedule and the time you commit to your courses.\n \nIf you were in a ‘brick and mortar’ school, you would be spending approximately 6 hours a day in dedicated academic work. You would also have from 1 to 3 hours of after school/home work to do. This totals about 8 hours a day of commitment to ‘going to school’. While we know that our virtual world is a bit more time efficient, we also know that you must commit an average of 6 hours a day for 5 days a week to remain on the appropriate pace to complete each course. For those taking 6 courses, that would equate to approximately 30 hours of dedicated work on your academics each week!!\n \nYOU MUST GO TO SCHOOL….. you must create a schedule of your time for “going to school”. Going to school IS the reason you are enrolled with us. We ARE your school and you ARE our student.\n \nParents, I cannot stress enough the importance of your role is assisting and supporting your child in the development of a routine on a daily basis. The routine may vary from day to day. It may vary the courses on certain days. It may look substantially different from prior weeks due to a change in focus. However, one thing should remain the same: commitment to maintaining consistent progress by ensuring time on task is dedicated.\n \nMany of you are finding yourselves behind. The attitude might be that you can always catch up. But you must keep in mind that ‘catching up’ does not mean skipping any required lessons or the assignments. You must “do the work”.\n \n“Do the work”….translation: Go to School….\n \nWhile you clearly are not ‘going to a brick and mortar’ school, you MUST “go to school” regularly and consistently to be successful academically. You must establish your routine or you will find yourself being very random with your efforts and your success will be decreasing.\n \nConfidence is great when applied with focus. Confidence is a killer when used as a crutch to defend procrastination! Put your confident attitudes of success and good grades in action with a plan – focus – follow up – complete your work!\n \nI leave you today by repeating the statement: GO TO SCHOOL….virtually!\n \n \n \n ",

If you account for a wife and 1 child per fighting man, that would make almost a 1000 people in Abraham's company, With families traveling by camel and on foot they would optimally travel a distance of around 20 miles per day not to mention that he didn't know precisely where he was going. Think about it,He left the only place he knew and went to a totally foreign place.His homeland of Ur was a large metropolis by all accounts, which was bordered by two impressive rivers. The people of Ur worshiped a moon God which housed many temples in the region. abrahm would have been taught by his father Terah the family religious practices. Abraham had to have been  truly transformed by his encounter with this new unfamiliar God,to forsake all he knew to follow Him. Abraham left everything  familiar to him to pursue an unparalleled friendship with not \"a god \"but,The only true,and living God. This relationship is why he's called the father of many nations as well as the father of our faith. Our messiah,  Yeshua is our ultimate benefit of this relationship between Abraham and YHVH\n Jesus told his disciples that because of their obedience to him they were his friends and revelation was a benefit of friendship, .(Jesus reveilled to his followers the meaning of his  parables- explaining his kingdom,the details of his death,resurrection,salvation \u0026last day signs of his eminent return, all because of their (friendship) through their obedience .)By the way, God even had dinner with Abraham to announce the promise seed (Issac) and reveiled  the impending judgement of Sodom \u0026 Gomorrah while securing Lots life, angels literally shapperonning him by the hand out of Sodom. However,Before Abraham responded to God's command \"Lech Le Cha \" he first had to overcome an internal issue that all humans are faced with at one time or another and can seem even instinctive; how to deal with fear of change. For many change can be difficult and in some cases debilitating. I'm prevledged  to interact with aircraft pilots on a regular bases at work  and most like to talk about their various war stories. Usually things that they've experienced while flying or when they were training to fly. I've been told that when pilots are training they're taught to go against their natural instincts,such as when they lose their aerial orientation. in such an emergency ,  they are taught to fall back on their training. They have been trained to look at specific gauges and ignore others to determine the accurate orientation of the plane. B.Y. family, we,ve seen our share of change over the years. We ve greeted many new friends and yet have said some sad goodbyes to others. We'll,I have just the training assignment for you if you start to feel disoriented by fear of change. First,Memorize and meditate on Hebrews 12:1-3 and remember we are family,we,re in this together. I want you to know that The elders of Beth Yeshua as well as the leadership have fervently prayed about what we perceive is the next step for this ministry and we feel certain that Yeshua is saying to us, Go. We want to obey this call. I believe our obedience will result in a more intimate friendship with God and each other,a deeper peace ,blessings and yes, revelation of Messiah's next steps for us as a community. We aren't being asked to travel a thousand miles or move a thousand people across the desert or occupy a strange land,though it will feel strange to leave a building that been our home for such a long time. I know we all know that Beth Yeshua is the people not the structure. But we feel this maybe just as important,as an act of obedience for our Beth Yeshua community at this time.\n\nBlessings family \n\n\n\nLech L Cha (go forth ,yourself)",

I am usually not impressed with dealers when they do any service on my car but this one takes the cake. The guy who worked on my car was Nelson. He was a super tall guy so I doubt anyone could miss him. I was a bit nervous about what they would say about my car but he was straight forward with all the work that needed to be done. Some things were unavoidable (alignment / brake pads) and others could wait till summer. At the end of my appointment, he showed me how bad my old brakes were worn down and even washed my car. Overall, I had a great experience here even though it took longer than normal. Everything turn out great and my car is running awesome now. I too am a fan of the service department. I just wish their sales team would act more professional around the showroom instead of horsing around. I would highly recommend Nelson to be your service guy at Toyota of Irving. Just ask for him and tell him Alex with the grey Camry sent you in there!",

        "script": "\n\n\nHey everyone! For those of you who may not know me, my name is Tausha Cameron and I am the Administrative Assistant here at Victory! Pastor Dan wanted me to share a little bit about my experience and my mission field it’s kinda unique and it just so happens to be in the pageant industry.\nWhen most people hear the word “pageant” they associate it with facial beauty and lots and lots of make-up, maybe even a girl trying to be something that they’re not. That couldn’t be any further from the truth in the case of scholarship pageantry and the pageants I have taken part in and will continue to be involved in. There are many pageant organizations that hold high moral standards for their contestants and title holders… and when I compete I take those standards to the next level!\nMy whole life I have strived to not only be seen as a positive role model but act upon that behavior. I believe a true role model lives by example and lives their life how you would want your child to live their life. That is with integrity, modesty, and compassion. Ministry is my passion and Scholarship Pageantry happens to be my hobby. With the opportunities I have been given to represent Wisconsin numerous of times with a variety of organizations I am enabled to combine them both, all while representing Christ.\nThis past summer I was able to go to Virginia Beach, Virginia to represent Wisconsin at Internationals. There were girls from all over the world! And one of many girls I got to know well and became close with was BreAnna, Miss Washington! To make a long story short we had A LOT in common all accept a relationship with Christ. Still to this day we text and I am able to encourage her and pray with her.\nI would have loved to talk to you all about my mission field live but I’m actually in Iowa encouraging my way to be the next Miss Wisconsin for America’s U.S. Miss but at these pageants I am able to pray with the girls I meet that week or weekend I am able to share how God turned my Tests into my Testimony and even stir up great conversation with the judges I meet in the one on one interview process. I have made a number of lifelong friendships with these girls by stepping out in faith and sharing God’s love. I am even able to stay in contact with them through social media and be an encouragement in their lives. \nI want to thank you all for listening to my little snippet of my mission field. And I want to leave you with this… I may wear a crown or a tiara but I serve the the one true king who sits on the ultimate throne and has a reign that never ends now pageantry is my mission field kind a unique kind a different right, I want you to ask yourself… what is your mission field?",

        "script": "Part 1: Introduction to Sustainable Funding\n\nHello, I’m Bradley Grieve the CEO of the Australian Youth Mentoring Network or the AYMN.\n\nThe AYMN is the national peak body for the youth mentoring sector and exists to strengthen the youth mentoring sector and champion all that it does.\n\nAt the beginning of 2013 we started our work on sustainable funding because it was important to look at funding and income holistically rather than focusing on one type of funding.\n\nFollowing that philosophy, we have developed a range of tools and resources to help organisations be more financially sustainable.\n\nBy the end of this course you will understand what sustainable funding is, and how it could work for your organisation. You will have learned about the main sources of income and their characteristics, and you will have improved your knowledge on the trends in the not-for-profit sector economy, and how they affect your organisation. You will also have the skills to implement a more sustainable approach to funding in your work.\n\nThe course is in three parts.\n\nIn part one, we look at what sustainable funding means and introduce the four main income streams.\n\nIn part two, we will look more closely at the different types of income, what they are like to work with and the trends happening right now.\n\nAnd in part three, we will look at how you can use the sustainable sun tool and the resource raising approach to embed sustainable funding across your organisation’s work.\n\nSo what do we mean by sustainable funding? One way to look at it is to use our ‘ABC of sustainable funding.  Sustainable funding is Appropriate, Balanced and Complete.\n\nAppropriate: each organisation is different and needs to find the most appropriate funding for them\n\nBalanced: means having a wide range of funding sources so your organisation can smooth out the ups and downs\n\nComplete: by having a complete idea of what your real spending is you can raise enough income to cover your costs.\n\nBy following the ABCs you can work out whether an income stream will be right for you, looking at whether it is Appropriate, Balanced and Complete.\n\nNow we’ll turn to the types of funding and income. We split them up into four main categories shown here on our ‘income spectrum’, Gifts, Grants, Contracts and Trading.\n\nThe first is Gifts.\n\nGifts are made by individuals to further the mission of an organisation. They might include community fundraising, individual giving, philanthropy and some kinds of corporate support. Here the relationship is with a “donor”.\n\nSecond is Grants. By grants we mean restricted funding to deliver specific work, often received after an application process. Here there is a relationship with a “funder”.\n\nThe next income stream is Contracts. These usually involve payment for provision of products or services according to agreed terms. Contracts are often between voluntary organisations and public bodies such as Governments or local councils. The relationship here is with a “purchaser”.\n\nFinally we have Trading, This means selling products or services to customers, not as part of a long-term structured contract. Trading and enterprise activity can include providing services or advice for a fee, or selling a product like a book. The relationship here is with a “customer”.\n\nThose are the four income streams in the income spectrum, and the vast majority of money in the not-for-profit sector fits into one of these categories. We’ll look at all four in more detail in the second part of this course.\n\nBut there are also some other things to consider alongside the income streams.\n\nWhether income is from a donor or a customer can sometimes be a tricky question. Income from sponsorship, membership or fundraising events can be considered gifts, or they can be in the open market. It depends on whether the person or organisation is understood to be getting a product or service in exchange for their money. If they are, they are a customer, if not, they are a donor. And this difference can affect tax deductibility for the giver.\n\nAnother thing to consider is Social Investment: Social investment sits outside the income spectrum, and can be used as a financial enabler, allowing your organisation to develop new projects, property, or anything else where finance is required.\n\nInvestment income includes rent from property, dividends and interest on deposits. This investment income represents a small share of the voluntary sector’s overall income, but for some organisations it is very important.\n\nGoing back to the income spectrum, now we’ve mapped it out, what do you do next?\n\nWell your first priority should be to take a look at your organisation to see where you fit. First of all, ask yourself which of the four streams is your biggest source of income. Then see if you can put a figure on the different categories, working out the percentage in each income stream. Finally, work out how many different sources of income are within that income stream, for example you may have 100 individual donors or five different grants coming into your organisation.\n\nYou might want to pause the video at this point and work out your biggest source of income, how much of your income is in each stream, and how many contributors you have in each of the four streams.\n\nOnce you have answered these questions, you can start to see if your income mix is risky. For example, if all your money is coming from one stream then you may be over-dependent on that type of income. Also, if your income streams are all ending soon this is another risk factor.\n\nTo take an example, I helped a Community Group to review their income from the current financial year. They had received a one-off grant of $25,000 from the government, and an annual grant of $5,000 from the local council (agreed for another three years). They also raised about $2000 from a community event.\n\nThis meant that the Group had $32,000 in the grants column of the income spectrum, which was 95 per cent of their income, a very high proportion. Our review also showed that 80 per cent of their income was ending this year and was unlikely to be renewed, so their income was very risky.\n\nThey needed to start planning right away to either scale back their expenditure quickly, or diversify and increase their income.\n\nSo how would the Group go about diversifying their income?\n\nThere are different ways that they could diversify. One is to spread out across the income spectrum. By developing new income in different streams they could spread the risk. For example the community group could diversify away from grant dependence by further developing their donor base, bringing in much more gift income. They could set about straight away with community fundraising activities and developing relationships with potential donors.\n\nAnother way that they could diversify their income is by bringing in more from existing income streams. For example, the community group had already secured two grants for their work. They could target other grant-makers to ensure that they weren’t so reliant on the income from the government and the council.  They could use a funding search website like to start exploring new grant and contract opportunities for their organisation.\n\nThe vital thing to remember about diversifying is that there is no magic formula for your organisation’s income. You could have a mix across all the income streams, or you could specialise in one of the four types of income. The trick is to not narrow your options.\n\nBut remember that money is just one piece of the puzzle. Other important factors include your organisation’s mission, vision and values, keeping those at the centre of the work you do. Also, you will need to have the right people in place to do your fundraising and income generation. Have you got the right skills already or do you need to invest in training or get in specialist advice? Last year we helped a number of organisations, through our training and consultancy, to improve their funding skills and strategies.\n\nFinally, measuring and reporting your impact is getting more and more important to show to funders and supporters that you are achieving real change in the world.\n\nSo Sustainable Funding is about planning your income holistically – all the different sources of income, plus the context and environment that is needed to support and enable financial sustainability for your work. Remember the ABCs - and look for income that is Appropriate, Balanced, and Complete.\n\nIn this section of the course we have covered the sustainable funding approach and the four main income streams, Gifts, Grants, Contracts and Trading.\n\nIn the next part of the course, we’ll be exploring more closely the characteristics of different income streams and current trends, and how sustainable funding works across your whole organisation.\n\n\nThank you.",

        "script": "Welcome to part three of the Introduction to Sustainable Funding course. This section looks in more detail at how you can improve your organisation’s overall financial health. In particular we’ll be looking at the six areas of sustainability, the sun tool which helps you map how you’re doing across them. We’ll also cover some key terminology and concepts that are crucial for you to understand and use, thinking about your assets and then looking at how you can pull this together into a useful planning process. Finally we’ll suggest some next steps.\n\n \n\nFor this part of the course, you will need the ‘Sustainable Sun Tool’, which you can download below. Pause this if you’d like to print out the download now but don’t worry if you don’t have a printer to hand, I’ll talk you through how to use the tool and you can always print it later.\n\n \n\nSo, looking at the Sun Tool, the first thing to notice is that income is actually only just one aspect. Our argument is that no organisation can be sustainable unless fundraising and income generation is supported by other areas. So, for instance, if you have trouble with financial management, you may not be able to provide the information needed to support a funding application, or you’ll have trouble managing the financial procedures once you’ve been successful.\n\n \n\nTo fill out the Sun tool you choose one option from each of the six areas that sounds most like your organisation. You then plot that on the sun – the closer to the middle, the better you’re doing. Then join the dots to make a probably somewhat wonky circle.\n\n\n\nPause this here if you’d like to do this now.\n\n\n\nSo, how does it look? Is there one area that stands out as needing some urgent work?\n\n\n\nYou may next want to ask different people within your organisation to complete this tool on their own. Then compare the results. It will be interesting to see where opinions differ and explore why this is. Why don’t you print out a few copies for your next planning day or trustee meeting?\n\n \n\nSo now we’ll look at some key terms you may come across when looking at income holistically. It is important to understand these, not just because you might hear others using them – particularly funders – but because they contribute to sustainability.\n\n \n\nThe first is Full Cost Recovery.\n\n \n\nThere are lots of different tools available to help you to work out full cost recovery, but the most important thing is to understand what it means and be aware of how it is reflected in your income generating and planning.\n\n \n\nFull Cost Recovery is a process by which organisations make sure that they are raising the real amount they need to cover the costs of their activities. All too often costs can be ‘hidden’ and therefore not budgeted for and not included in fundraising. For instance, even volunteers are likely to have costs attached to them – they’ll need some sort of management, they might use your building or your stationary and computers. And what would happen if a key volunteer couldn’t help you any more? What would it cost to get this help elsewhere?\n\n \n\nSo, when you’re budgeting, you’ll need to work out how to allocate a proportion of the relevant costs to volunteers and find out their real cost. Then you need to work out how to raise this money. Perhaps you have decided to pay for it from surplus from elsewhere. Or perhaps you can fundraise for them.\n\n \n\nLet’s think about some other hidden costs.\n\n \n\nA project giving support and advice to young people might have some obvious direct costs – staff time working with the young people, the cost of the venue you’ll be using, maybe paying travel expenses. But there will also be a proportion of lots of other costs – management of the project, of the staff involved and the organisation in general, administrative support, insurance and utility bills. Without deciding how much of these this project is using, you don’t know its full cost. This means that you possibly won’t be raising enough money but also that you might not make the right strategic decisions about which projects are the best use of your organisation’s resources. After all, you want to be achieving the most with the resources that you have.\n\n \n\nYou might want to set up a spreadsheet to work this out – so, for instance, you could enter how much time a project spends in the building, and it could apportion building related costs accordingly. You might want to think about how this varies over time. New projects will always take more management time – and probably more admin too, whereas projects that are coming to the end of a grant will require more fundraising, evaluation and possibly reporting.\n\n \n\nWhen you add up all the costs your organisation occurs, you should then be able to see which project is using what.\n\n \n\nWe have an example case study from BTCV (the Brisbane Trust for Conservation Volunteers) on our website that describes how they went about setting up a system for Full Cost Recovery. Your system doesn’t have to be flawless – in fact, most are a work in progress, but it does have to give you a good idea of where your resources are being used.\n\n \n\nThe next key terms, Outputs, Outcomes and Impact, you’ve probably heard of, but it’s amazing how many people don’t really understand what they mean, or don’t remember to make them clear. I’ve marked applications from organisation of different sizes and experience, and the mistake is all too common.\n\n \n\nOutputs are the things you actually do. So you might deliver a training course, or talk to 20 people, or produce an art work. Outputs are usually tangible and can easily be evidenced. These are the easy things to record.\n\n \n\nOutcomes are trickier. They are the things that happened as a result of your outputs. So, you talked to 20 people and as a result, they understood how they could recycle more. How do you demonstrate that they understood? You produce and art work that communicates to visitors to your local shopping centre some of the emotions felt by teenagers. \n\n \n\nSo what? That’s your impact – your outputs result in outcomes that lead to a change, an impact – the difference you’ve made to people’s lives or the wider world. Sometimes funding applications only ask for outcomes – they almost always mean impact too. And you should be able to provide some evidence – even if it is ‘soft’ evidence of a case study or a quote. If four of the people on your training course went on to use their new skills to get jobs (the outcome) then so what? Well for one participant, this had the impact that he was able to move to a secure home with his family and his son, Jonny, has been able to settle in at school.\n\n \n\nIt can help to get someone else to check that you are really demonstrating your impact, not just stating your outputs or outcomes. And you should be able to communicate it to anyone, via any media.\n\nTo help you to check whether you’re clear on the differences between Outputs, Outcomes and Impact, I’ve written a mini-quiz you can download below.\n\n \n\nSo, moving on, another key piece of terminology is Asset. Assets are, in this case, economic resources. They are things that could be converted into a financial value. Often, organisations have assets that are ‘hidden’. For instance, you may have a building that you are not realising the full value of (how about renting out some space, or even installing solar panels).\n\n \n\nIt could be that your staff or volunteers are hidden assets – could their skills be used to generate income? Or maybe some of your activities could have a double life, producing spin-off publications or training courses?\n\n \n\nThis diagram helps you to think about where your resources lie.\n\n \n\nThis is taken from an excellent report by Caroline Beaumont developed through the Clore Social Leadership programme.\n\n \n\nIf you think back to part one when we thought about income streams, we were talking about how different types of income fit with your organisation. This helps you to look at your organisation in more detail. Think about getting the right income - what you actually need funding for, and what you already have, or could access in kind.\n\n \n\nGoing back to the three Ss – understanding what is suitable is about understanding what you actually need money for, and what you don’t.\n\n \n\nIt’s also about understanding how changing the way you generate income might fit with the culture of your organisation. What steps do you need to take to make it work, to ensure your staff and volunteers are happy with a new approach. If you want to take this exercise a step further, you can download it below.\n\n \n\nFinally, don’t forget to build in proper planning. Sustainable funding isn’t something that is a discrete activity you can do on your own, or as a one-off. You need to evaluate your mission, build a suitable strategy, craft an achievable plan from that and build in regular reviews. Do you need trigger points for action? (for instance, should certain things have happened by a specific time, or a certain amount of money have been secured?) This planning cycle gives you an example of the types of steps you ought to be taking, but in a way it’s deceptive – you need to be revisiting all the steps regularly.\n\n \n\nSo, this is the end of our Introduction to Sustainable Funding mini-course. What do you need to do now?\n\n \n\nDecide what your most urgent action needs to be – perhaps the sun tool or the income spectrum could help you.\n\n \n\nCheck the materials you already have – are you communicating your Outputs, Outcomes and Impact clearly? Are you able to justify your costs if asked?\n\n \n\nWork out any ‘gaps’ in your knowledge, skills or systems that could hold you back.\n\n \n\nMake sure you can keep up momentum – it’s very easy to lose sight of your goals when your workload is heavy. Perhaps signing up to our newsletter, booking into a more advanced course or arranging a meeting with relevant people could help.\n\n \n\nSo, in this Introduction to Sustainable Funding course we’ve covered the ‘income spectrum’ – looking beyond raising money from just one source to thinking wider to all potential sources of funding – gifts and donations, grants, contracts, trading and loan finance or social investment. We’ve taken you through some of the features of each of these and the current trends they are experiencing. And then in this section we’ve placed funding in a wider context, showing you a way you can assess how sustainable your organisation is and explaining some key terms you will need to learn.\n\n \n\nTake a look at the AYMN website for all our sustainable funding tools and resources. Now you’ve completed this introductory course, it might be that you want to take Sustainable Funding further with one of our more advanced. Or, if you think you need more bespoke or in-depth support, then perhaps consultancy would be more suitable. Again, you can find all our resources, including information about AYMN consultancy, on our website. Many of the tools we use in our training courses are free to download too. I hope you’ve found this course helpful. If you take away only two things please remember, 1. Being sustainable is about resource-raising, not fundraising and 2. Sustainable funding can only be successful when integrated and understood by your whole organisation – it is a team activity.\n\n \n\nThank you",

If four of the people on your training course went on to use their new skills to get jobs (the outcome) then so what? Well for one participant, this had the impact that he was able to move to a secure home with his family, and his son, Jonny, has been able to settle in at school.\n\nIt can help to get someone else to check that you are really demonstrating your impact, not just stating your outputs or outcomes. And you should be able to communicate it to anyone, via any media.\n\nTo help you to check whether you’re clear on the differences between Outputs, Outcomes and Impact, I’ve written a mini-quiz you can download below.\n\nSo, moving on, another key piece of terminology is Asset. Assets are, in this case, economic resources. They are things that could be converted into a financial value. Often, organisations have assets that are ‘hidden’. For instance, you may have a building that you are not realising the full value of (how about renting out some space\n\nIt could be that your staff or volunteers are hidden assets – could their skills be used to generate income? Or maybe some of your activities could have a double life, producing spin-off publications or training courses?\n\nThis diagram helps you to think about where your resources lie.\n\n\nThis is taken from an excellent report by Caroline Beaumont developed through the Clore Social Leadership programme.\n\n\nIf you think back to part one when we thought about income streams, we were talking about how different types of income fit with your organisation. This helps you to look at your organisation in more detail. Think about getting the right income - what you actually need funding for, and what you already have, or could access in kind.\n\n\nGoing back to the ABCs understanding what is appropriate is about understanding what you actually need money for, and what you don’t.\n\nIt’s also about understanding how changing the way you generate income might fit with the culture of your organisation. What steps do you need to take to make it work, to ensure your staff and volunteers are happy with a new approach. If you want to take this exercise a step further, you can download it below.\n\nFinally, don’t forget to build in proper planning. Sustainable funding isn’t something that is a discrete activity you can do on your own, or as a one-off. You need to evaluate your mission, build a suitable strategy, craft an achievable plan from that and build in regular reviews. Do you need trigger points for action? (for instance, should certain things have happened by a specific time, or a certain amount of money have been secured?) This planning cycle gives you an example of the types of steps you ought to be taking, but in a way it’s deceptive – you need to be revisiting all the steps regularly.\n\n\nSo, this is the end of our Introduction to Sustainable Funding mini-course. What do you need to do now?\n\n \nDecide what your most urgent action needs to be – perhaps the sun tool or the income spectrum could help you.\n\n\nCheck the materials you already have – are you communicating your Outputs, Outcomes and Impact clearly? Are you able to justify your costs if asked?\n\n\nWork out any ‘gaps’ in your knowledge, skills or systems that could hold you back.\n\n\nMake sure you can keep up momentum – it’s very easy to lose sight of your goals when your workload is heavy. Perhaps signing up to our newsletter, booking into a more advanced course or arranging a meeting with relevant people could help.\n\n \n\nSo, in this Introduction to Sustainable Funding course we’ve covered the ‘income spectrum’ – looking beyond raising money from just one source to thinking wider to all potential sources of funding – gifts and donations, grants, contracts, trading and loan finance or social investment. We’ve taken you through some of the features of each of these and the current trends they are experiencing. And then in this section we’ve placed funding in a wider context, showing you a way you can assess how sustainable your organisation is and explaining some key terms you will need to learn.\n\n\nTake a look at the AYMN website for all our sustainable funding tools and resources. Now you’ve completed this introductory course, it might be that you want to take Sustainable Funding further, if you think you need more bespoke or in-depth support, then perhaps consultancy would be more suitable. Again, you can find all our resources, including information about AYMN consultancy, on our website. Many of the tools we use in our training courses are free to download too. I hope you’ve found this course helpful. If you take away only two things please remember, 1. Being sustainable is about resource-raising, not fundraising and 2. Sustainable funding can only be successful when integrated and understood by your whole organisation – it is a team activity.\n\n \n\nThank you",

        "script": "Hello and welcome to the second of the three instalments of this short course on sustainable funding – or as we sometimes put it – how to keep on keeping on.\n\nAs a quick recap of what happened in the first instalment we looked at the main reasons of why sustainable funding seems so distant to many not-for-profits and it is because of the simple fact that we simply don’t set out with it in mind. We don’t plan for it. We’re too busy focusing on helping others to be bothered to help ourselves. We also looked at the ABCs of sustainable funding and the four different income types – Donation, Grants, Contracts and Trading. In this session, we’re setting our sights on the trends of each the income streams and looking at what the trends means for you. And, rather bravely some would say, we’re also go to try and convince you that profit is not a naughty word, even in the not-for-profit sector, rather, it is a word must become part of our lexicon if we are genuinely serious about creating a more equitable and equal world.\n\nSo, let’s not waffle any further, let’s get to it.\n\nThe first thing to understand in our quest for social equity and equality is that not all income sources are created equal.  Each type of income has characteristics that make them more appropriate to some organisations, and less so to others and it is these distinctions, when clearly understood, that allow programs to fine tune their sustainable funding models. So let’s have look at an example of some of these differences.\n\nLet’s start with contracts - there are many factors which can affect whether an organisation is able to bid for contracts - their size for example. They may not have enough staff with enough time to put a bid together, or their track record may preclude them from bidding altogether because they haven’t been delivering services for long enough. Many contracts also require organisations to have a good chunk of money in the bank as payment won’t be given until the project is complete. These differences can mean that funders often need to lean towards larger organisations or those who can form partnerships.  Equally, many forms of gift fundraising have their own variations and often need organisations to have a strong relationship with their community or a popular ‘brand’ and strong marketing skills.\n\nThese different characteristics mean that whilst looking at trends can be useful, you need to be aware of hidden variation.\n\nWe’re now going to explore some of the main characteristics and trends of each different type of income.\n\nDonations are great as they normally give you unrestricted income however they can be unpredictable. You can’t always plan on someone making a large donation or leaving you a bequest. There are lots of different types of donor and ways to give but it takes time build up a strong donor base.\n\nLet’s now look at trends in donations, and what you need to think about if you want to increase your income in this area.\n\nFirstly we are a spectacular nation of givers both in time and money. A percentage of 65% per cent of adult Australians donated to charitable causes in 2014. Levels of giving by individuals have remained more or less stable over the past 4 years.\n\nPeople are most likely to give to causes that support medical research or children \u0026 young people. Other popular causes are overseas aid and hospitals. Health and cultural organisations also provide a strong pull. Donors give to causes that are close to their hearts and causes that they believe it.\n\nBuying charity merchandise is the most popular method of giving with 50% saying they give to charities this way but this was closely followed by cash with 49% of all donors who gave gave in cash. Women are most likely to give money.\n\nLegacies and bequests are an important source of income but still only 7 per cent of people in Australia leave a charitable gift in their will. So this is an untapped market as many people are not aware of the option to leave a gift when they write their will. Don’t be afraid to ask, especially from donors that you know well. As a guide the size of the bequest market in the UK is £2 billion a year or $3.5 billion which is greater than the entire fundraising efforts of Australia combined.\n\nIf you want to increase gifts you will need to think about donor motivation and why someone would want to give to your cause. This can help you to start thinking about how you could attract that type of donor.\n\nIt is advisable to offer your donors as many different methods to give as possible however the trends show us that different donor groups can favour different methods of giving. For example online donations are increasing and are favoured by both those aged 25 to 44 and the over 60’s. New research from shows us that there is a real increase in online giving and more is given online than face to face.\n\nNow let’s look at Grants.\n\nA grant is often restricted income which means that the funder has put conditions on what the money is spent on. There is normally a formal (and competitive) application process and the funder has outcomes of their own that they want to be met. Funders will require you to submit monitoring information, to show how you’ve spent the grant. Unspent funds may have to be returned to funder but this is often negotiable. You will normally have a grant agreement, terms and conditions or even a contract\n\nWe think grants are really important for the voluntary sector, and there are still plenty of grant programmes out there. There’s no doubt, though, that there is increased competition for funds. So let’s look at the other trends\n\nPublic sector grants still count for a huge proportion of the voluntary sector’s income, though it is likely that government spending cuts will continue into 2016. Many local authorities have scaled back or cut their grant programmes completely.\n\nTrusts and Foundations have also reported an increase in the number of ineligible applications and this says two things 1. many organisations are desperate for resources and 2. the shot gun approach to grant funding doesn’t work as ineligible applications will go straight in the bin.                        \n\nSmaller trusts tend to ‘go with who they know’ – so go back to your funders and make a new proposal to them.\n\nFunders are increasingly looking for grant holders to demonstrate the social impact of their work. When done badly, this can increase the monitoring burden on voluntary organisations; however, being able to show your impact is key to attracting new funders and supporters.\n\nThere has also been an increase in more engaged grant making. Where grants are offered along with a package of support, think funders like the Impetus Trust.\n\nNow let’s look at Contracts.\n\nWith contracts there is always a restriction on how money is spent. There is usually a formal (and often competitive) application or tender process. Profit can be built in to your bid or tender but you need to consider the legal and financial risks if outcomes or outputs are not delivered. GST applies in many cases, depending on the type of services.\n\nThe proportion of voluntary sector income from statutory contracts has more than doubled in last 10 years (but with huge variations across the sector). This is in part due to government channelling more funding through a procurement model than a grant model, but also because the sector is gaining experience in winning and delivering contracts.\n\nThe ‘Opening up public services’ and payment by results agendas are likely to affect organisations involved in delivering contracts in the future\n\nPayment by Results is the practice of paying providers for delivering services after agreed results have been achieved.\n\nIt intends to reward performance, or outcomes, instead of activity, or outputs. It staggers spending and risk between the funder and the provider. If you are not sure what is meant by the terms outcomes and outputs we explain those terms in more depth in part three.\n\nSo there is a positive motive, but the current reality is that there is a lack of efficiency and transparency, and Payment By Results can be very difficult for organisations that don’t have the resources to deliver before payment.\n\nFinally, we need to think about Consortia and sub-contracting.\n\nBigger contracts and demand for partnership working increase the need to work together. Consortia and sub-contracting can provide great opportunities to pool skills and resources, but can also be complex and costly to set up, and you need to be careful about allocation of risk.\n\nSo lastly, Trading.\n\nTrading provides unrestricted income. It involves a customer transaction, and customers may not be the same people as your beneficiaries. Something else to note is that you may need to change your legal structure to allow your organisation to trade. Remember that income above certain amount is taxable.\n\nSo what are the trends in trading to watch for?\n\nWe’ve seen a recent growth in ethical consumerism, as well as a growth in finance providers specialising in supporting social enterprise.\n\nThe term ‘Social enterprise’ is increasingly recognised by Government as an important activity in delivering public services.\n\nThere’s also more public awareness of trading for social benefits, with initiatives like Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant appearing on mainstream television.\n\nIn additional to these four types of income, we’re seeing an increased interest in social investment models, where private finance is used to fund a social and financial return.\n\nYou may have heard of the ‘Social Impact Bond’, where central government or a social business uses investment from private investors to fund voluntary sector organisations to deliver social outcomes. For example the first UK scheme, launched in 2010 was based on prisoner re-offending rates.\n\nIf the outcomes are met, government pays back the investors with interest. It is a way of raising capital when it’s needed, and is a form of payment by results. At the moment there are only a few trials with large organisations. However, there are lots of other forms of social investment, such as small loans to help you bridge a funding gap, or overdrafts to help cash flow when you have a large one-off payment to make.\n\nSo, where do you fit?\n\nLook at the income spectrum exercise from the first part of this training. Bearing in mind the general picture across the sector, how do you feel about the long-term stability of your income? Do you think you have a strong enough mix of income? Or are you reliant on one type?\n\nWe have an exercise for you to download below, that will help you assess where your organisation’s income sits at the moment, and where your risks lie.\n\nIn the final video of this course, we’ll be explaining some key terms and concepts for sustainable funding, exploring how you can assess your organisation’s financial sustainability and providing you with the 7 habits of highly sustainable programs.\n\nThank you.",

I bet you get a high volume of Channel Managers, like myself, reaching out to you constantly wanting to discuss their Partner Program. \n\nWill your schedule permit a 30minute introductory call next Wednesday?\n\nLooking forward to speaking with you and have a great day.",

        "script": "I would like to thank Jerry and the award committee for selecting me for this great honor. \n\nI turned 45 this year and did a fair amount of reflection on my life and I realized that according to actuarial tables I’ve already likely lived more than half of it.  I also reflected on the my professional life path and the decisions I have made over time… it’s just then that I realized I was destined to be a pharmacist.  How you might ask could I determine that?  It’s because all the tough decisions, even early on in my life, have been made using the same principles I use to be the best Pharmacist I could be.  Many of these principles I learned as a MS, PP then Specialty resident here at OSUMC. I would like to share 4 of these with the residents and younger pharmacists this evening. \n\nThe first of these is “take ownership of your decisions”.  We all know them, people who make excuses or refuse to take ownership for their choices in their professional and/or personal lives. I have found that it’s not because they aren’t smart or gifted in life, but it’s because they are unable to make good valued decisions or are afraid or embarrassed of the consequences of making decisions with limited empirical data. \n\n    Well as I say to my pharmacy students and faculty at St. John Fisher College on a daily basis, we need to prepare ourselves for the “grey zone.”  Think about it, our physician colleagues are not going to ask us questions they can look up in 30 seconds on their iPhone, they ask us questions were there is little to no data and they want us to give them a valued judgment based on the principles of pharmacotherapy, not random facts that we memorized in pharmacy school or in residency.  I believe this is analogous to life decisions, if we are grounded in moral and ethical principles and stick to these principles we can sleep soundly at night.  Even if these decisions turn out to be inaccurate you can have satisfaction in knowing you did the best you could. \n\n    Now as residents and younger pharmacists many of you are not as grounded in principles of pharmacy practice as others who have more experience.  That is the whole idea of residency, this time right now, this one or two extra years of residency training not only helps you gain confidence in your practice of pharmacy but instills in you principles of practice that will last your entire professional career.  So take advantage of this time then and soak them up! OSUMC is a very special place…You have preceptors here to help you as they did me to find your way.\n\n   Second, we all make mistakes, use them as life lessons and learn from them.  Not just in detail, but look for the larger principle.  One of the most difficult life lessons I learned was as a MS resident at OSUMC.  I spent many a busy weekend in the IV room checking IV’s, preparing and checking chemo and TPN’s as many of us did.  This was my only exposure to being a practicing traditional pharmacy, the rest of the time I was working on projects and in class.  One particular weekend I made a single key stroke error on a neonatal TPN.  That simple key stroke error resulted in me programing the device to deliver 100 x the intended amount of Na.  This error was not picked up for 3 days and the babies serum Na rose to ~180 mEq/L (high normal is 150).   When I was told I was devastated.  I have been through rough times, especially as a young corpseman on the battle field in the 1st Gulf war.  You see right about them my wife Kristen and I were trying desperately to have a child and the fact that I put a baby’s life in jeopardy weighed heavy on my heart. After my devastating experience making a medication error I learned that bench work involving hand eye coordination and maintaining long stretches with meticulous attention to detail within a busy noisy area is not an area in which I could thrive.  I had no problem with the cognitive stuff like answering questions in pressure situations and having a passion for clinical practice, research and most of all finding creative ways to address practical problems.  I also realized that I needed to be a Pharmacist first, not a manager or a student or even a researcher, but a pharmacist.  The truth is I still struggle with this today.  I have over 30 direct reports and always try to be there for them and all my students, but I need to still practice in order for me to be true to who I am.  That is something I will never give up. \n\nThis leads me into my next life lesion: find your way professionally that allows you to put yourself in a position to be your definition of successful.  I want to be clear here…Success is a subjective metric that only you can determine with specific granularity.  This is something I learned from Jerry very early on in residency and never forgot it.  For me …I’m not a guy who is good at checking medication, that’s not my strength.  I found this out using reflection as a means to listen to myself and find out where my strengths and passions align.  But rather my strength turned out to be working with young pharmacists and pharmacy students to help them find their way.\n\n       As an OSUMC MS resident I struggled for many of the reasons I outlined earlier and realized I needed to be actively engaged in practice.  It was not that the program wasn’t challenging or that I didn’t like taking classes and projects, but it wasn’t for me at that point in my life.  So then I changed to the PP residency at OSUMC.  Then it happened!  I found ID again…  You see in pharmacy school I enjoyed ID and did well in it, but I also did well in other areas as well.  But, now it just clicked with me and I had a program director that pushed me to not only challenge myself as a clinician but as a researcher and educator as well.  Dr. Goff had high expectations which was what I liked about her.  She didn’t want excuses, but rather emphasized creativity and gave me the tools to thrive and be successful.  That final year for me at OSUMC was a glimpse into what I wanted to do.  Have a career filled with challenging clinical practice, meaningful research and work with students and post-doc to help shape their careers like Debbie and Jerry did for me.\n\n  The last life lesion I would like to leave you with is to give back.  One of my favorite scriptures from the bible is “for those who much is given, much is expected”.  This means that those of us who are privileged enough to have trained at such a wonderful place, we have to be resolute in  our commitment to providing similar experiences for our young clinicians where we practice.  I’m reminded of this every day, when I look up from my desk at work and see words “message to Garcia on a small green book that was given to me just over 11 years ago by folks that invested everything in helping me find my way.  I’ll close with a simple thank you to of you who helped me along the way.  OH…IO.     \n\n \n\n \n\n ",

        "script": "\nIn this next series of lessons, we'll be discussing how you can use a/b testing, otherwise known as split testing, to improve your conversion rate. But first, we should answer the question: what exactly is a/b testing?\n\nThe best way to describe what a/b testing is is to give you an illustration. Imagine that, one hot summer day, little Sam and Sally are selling lemonade from a little stand on their driveway in their busy neighborhood. There is a sign on the table that says \"Lemonade - 25 cents\". To the right of the sign is a pitcher of lemonade and a stack of plastic cups. So far, out of 6 people that have walked by, only 1 person stopped and purchased a cup of lemonade. And that was 3 neighbors ago.\n\nSam says with a defeated frown to Sally, \"I wish we could sell more lemonade.\"  A few seconds goes by... Then she says to Sam, \"Hold on.\" She rushes back inside the home. A couple minutes later, she comes out with a bowl containing a few slices of lemon and a notebook and pen. As she sits down, Sally takes out the notebook and draws a line down the middle of a page, dividing the page into two columns. She writes \"A\" at the top of the first column and \"B\" at the top of the other. She then puts an \"X\" in the  \"A\" column. \n\nShe then says to Sammy, \"I wanna try something.\" With that, she dumps the lemon slices into the pitcher of lemonade.\n\n\"Hey! We don't need more lemons... It's already yummy!\" Sam objects.\n\n\"Let's just see what happens.\"\n\nA few minutes later, a lady walks by and sees the lemonade. \"My, doesn't that look good! Can I buy a cup please?\"\n\nSam and Sally smile as they sell another cup of lemonade. While the lady drinks the lemonade, Sally puts a check mark in the \"B\" column. \n\nAs the lady walks away, Sally reaches into the pitcher and pulls out all of the lemon slices with a fork and places them back into the bowl that they were originally brought in. She then puts the bowl away out of sight.\n\n\"What are you doing?!!\" asked Sam, who was now very confused. \"The lemons worked... Why did you take them out?\"\n\n\"Let's just see what happens.\"\n\nA few minutes later, a man walked by. \"I could use some of that kids. I'd like one lemonade please.\"\n\nOnce the man walked away, Sam gloated, \"I guess we didn't need those stupid lemons.\" Sally ignored him and wrote a check mark in the \"A\" column. She then dumped the lemon slices back in. \"Oh come on!\" Exclaimed Sam. \"We don't need the stupid lemon slices!\"\n\nAnd this continued for the rest of the morning. Sally would take the lemon slices out after one person and then would remove them for the next. Back and forth. Back and forth. And when a neighbor bought lemonade, she'd put a checkmark in the corresponding column. But when the neighbor walked on by without a lemonade, an x.\n\nAt the end of the morning, they brought everything back to the house. Sally counted the x's and checkmarks. Sam looked on as she wrote a 3 under column a and 5 under b and circled it. Sally concluded, \"I think having the lemon slices was a good idea.\" \n\nThe next weekend was even hotter and Sally repeated her experiment. Sam was starting to get curious if this was really going to work. A few hours later, she tallied the results... 2 in column a and 5 in column b. \"See?\" Sam gloated, \" I told you we needed the lemons!\"\n\nWhat Sally did was perform a basic example of split, or a/b testing. Did you notice how she would go back and forth with each new potential customer? And how she kept careful track? And then, she came to a conclusion of which test she thought was the winner.\n\nBut there's it didn't stop there, did it? No. She tested it again the following weekend. \n\nWhat do you suppose she did the week after that? Well, once both Sam and Sally felt they tested the lemon slices enough and were pretty sure that they sold more with the slices, Sally tried a new variation. Of course, it wouldn't be wise to leave the lemons out. So she left them in. But Sam was really confused when he saw Sally bringing out another pitcher of lemonade. \n\n\"What are you doing? We can't sell that much lemonade! And Mom's gonna kill you... That's her nice pitcher!\" said Sam.\n\n\"Just chill out.\" And Sam did. He watched as, with every neighbor that passed by, Sally would now swap between the two pitchers of lemonade and keep track of which pitcher was selling more. The original pitcher with the lemon slices was now the a column. And the new pitcher was now the b column.\n\nYou see, Sally wondered if Mom's nicer crystal pitcher would make the lemonade look tastier and help them sell more. And it turned out she was right.\n\nSo you see, a/b testing isn't just something you do one time. It's an ongoing process. And the theory is that, with each iteration, you will improve (or learn what hurts) your conversions. And you probably noticed that she only made one change at a time. Why do you think? ** PAUSE ** That's right! If she tried all kinds of ideas at once, she wouldn't necessarily know which ideas worked or didn't. With one change at a time, there's less chance of messing it up. But there is a way to test multiple changes at once in a systematic way. This is called multi-variate testing, and we'll cover that a couple lessons from now.\n\nNow that you know what split testing, otherwise known as a/b testing, is, how would you use this valuable skill in your online marketing? That's the subject of our next lesson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "script": "Hello and welcome to home stretch of this short course on sustainable funding. In this section were going to be discussing some key terminology, talking through the 7 habits of highly sustainable organisations and we’ll also show you a tool that you can use to work out where on the sustainability spectrum you sit.\n\nSo we’ll begin with looking at some key terms you may come across when looking at income holistically. It is important to understand these, not just because you might hear others using them – particularly funders – but because they contribute to sustainability.\n\n \n\nThe first is Full Cost Recovery.\n\n \n\nThere are lots of different tools available to help you to work out full cost recovery, but the most important thing is to understand what it means and be aware of how it is reflected in your income generating and planning.\n\n \n\nFull Cost Recovery is a process by which organisations make sure that they are raising the real amount they need to cover the costs of their activities. All too often costs can be ‘hidden’ and therefore not budgeted for and not included in fundraising. For instance, even volunteers are likely to have costs attached to them – they’ll need some sort of management, they might use your building or your stationary and computers. And what would happen if a key volunteer couldn’t help you anymore? What would it cost to get this help elsewhere?\n\n \n\nSo, when you’re budgeting, you’ll need to work out how to allocate a proportion of the relevant costs to volunteers and find out their real cost. Then you need to work out how to raise this money. Perhaps you have decided to pay for it from surplus from elsewhere. Or perhaps you can fundraise for them.\n\n \n\nLet’s think about some other hidden costs.\n\n \n\nA project giving support and advice to young people might have some obvious direct costs – staff time working with the young people, the cost of the venue you’ll be using, maybe paying travel expenses. But there will also be a proportion of lots of other costs – management of the project, of the staff involved and the organisation in general, administrative support, insurance and utility bills. Without deciding how much of these this project is using, you don’t know its full cost. This means that you possibly won’t be raising enough money but also that you might not make the right strategic decisions about which projects are the best use of your organisation’s resources. After all, you want to be achieving the most with the resources that you have.\n\n \n\nYou might want to set up a spreadsheet to work this out – so, for instance, you could enter how much time a project spends in the building, and it could apportion building related costs accordingly. You might want to think about how this varies over time. New projects will always take more management time – and probably more admin too, whereas projects that are coming to the end of a grant will require more fundraising, evaluation and possibly reporting.\n\n \n\nWhen you add up all the costs your organisation occurs, you should then be able to see which project is using what.\n\n \n\nThe next key terms, Outputs, Outcomes and Impact, you’ve probably heard of, but it’s amazing how many people don’t really understand what they mean, or don’t remember to make them clear.\n\n \n\nOutputs are the things you actually do. So you might deliver a training course, or talk to 20 people, or produce an art work. Outputs are usually tangible and can easily be evidenced. These are the easy things to record.\n\n \n\nOutcomes are trickier. They are the things that happened as a result of your outputs. So, you talked to 20 people and as a result, they understood how they could recycle more. How do you demonstrate that they understood? You produce and art work that communicates to visitors to your local shopping centre some of the emotions felt by teenagers.  How do you measure what was communicated?\n\n \n\nThe next term is impact or sometime colloquially known as so what? That’s your impact – your outputs result in outcomes that lead to a change, an impact – the difference you’ve made to people’s lives or the wider world. Sometimes funding applications only ask for outcomes – they almost always mean impact too. And you should be able to provide some evidence – even if it is ‘soft’ evidence of a case study or a quote. If four of the people on your training course went on to use their new skills to get jobs (the outcome) then so what? Well for one participant, this had the impact that he was able to move to a secure home with his family and his son, has been able to settle in at school and his grades have improved\n\n \n\nIt can help to get someone else to check that you are really demonstrating your impact, not just stating your outputs or outcomes. And you should be able to communicate it to anyone, via any media.  To help you to check whether you’re clear on the differences between Outputs, Outcomes and Impact, I’ve written a mini-quiz you can download below.\n\n \n\nSo now for the seven habits of highly sustainable programs\n\n \n\nInspired employees go the extra mile\n\nThe biggest differentiator between highly sustainable organisations is the employee’s connection with the organisation’s vision. Living an inspiring vision is habit 1 because it is so foundational to both high performance and the other six habits. A senior leadership team that espouses a vision for their organisation that inspires their employees is far more likely to gain employee buy-in, followed by the extra discretionary effort, energy and focus from employees that are essential to achieve sustainable high performance.\n\nA clear strategy points employees in the right direction\n\nHaving developed and articulated an inspiring vision and purpose for their organisation, highly sustainable organisations develop clear strategies and goals to achieve that vision and purpose. The vision, purpose, strategies and goals become the single guiding light that points the way for employees and adds focus and urgency to their individual plans, actions and goals. The highly sustainable organisations in our database make a priority of communicating their strategies clearly.\n\nHigh performing people drive organisational results\n\nOne of the most crucial roles of a board is to select, recruit, develop, coach and support the best CEO they can find to lead their organisation. Great CEOs know that they will be far more able to realise their vision and achieve their objectives and goals if they get the right people on the team. They realise that they don’t only need to select and recruit, but also develop, coach and support the best possible team to take the journey with them.\n\nCreating long term customer loyalty\n\nAlmost all organisations show some level of commitment to their customers. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t survive. The commitment of highly sustainable organisations is much greater, more structured and thoughtful than low performance organisations. Highly sustainable organisations take a longer term view to customer loyalty. They are more likely to partner with their clients by really getting to know them and how they can serve them better.\n\nInadequate systems undermine performance\n\nThe highly sustainable organisations make sure that their systems are fit for purpose and well integrated as a key enabler for improving productivity and customer service.\n\n6. A willingness to innovate and be radical\n\nAnita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop, exhorted leaders to “be daring, be first, be different, be just”. Hence, sustainability leaders recognise that difficult problems require creative solutions whilst keep social ideals in mind.\n\n7. A long-term perspective on impacts\n\nSustainable organisations think much longer term longer term than unsustainable organisations. The point in terms of sustainability is that long term thinking is important for leaders  and it is important to make long term plan and look at ways of making things more efficient. You can make all these plans ahead of time and move in the right direction. And our experience is that the employees will really react very well to those kind of long-term plans. You get more out of the employees than you might expect if you embark on such a journey.\n\nFor the next part of the course, you will need our ‘Sustainable Sun Tool’, which you can download below. Pause this if you’d like to print out the download now but don’t worry if you don’t have a printer to hand, I’ll talk you through how to use the tool and you can always print it later.\n\n \n\nSo, looking at the Sun Tool, the first thing to notice is that income is actually only just one aspect. Our argument is that no organisation can be sustainable unless fundraising and income generation is supported by other areas. So, for instance, if you have trouble with financial management, you may not be able to provide the information needed to support a funding application, or you’ll have trouble managing the financial procedures once you’ve been successful.\n\n \n\nTo fill out the Sun tool you choose one option from each of the six areas that sounds most like your organisation. You then plot that on the sun – the closer to the middle, the better you’re doing. Then join the dots to make a probably somewhat wonky circle.\n\n \n\nPause this here if you’d like to do this now.\n\n \n\nSo, how does it look? Is there one area that stands out as needing some urgent work?\n\n \n\nYou may next want to ask different people within your organisation to complete this tool on their own. Then compare the results. It will be interesting to see where opinions differ and explore why this is. Why don’t you print out a few copies for your next planning day or trustee meeting?\n\n \n\nSo, this is the end of our Introduction to Sustainable Funding mini-course. What do you need to do now?\n\n \n\nDecide what your most urgent action needs to be – perhaps the sun tool or the income spectrum could help you.\n\n \n\nCheck the materials you already have – are you communicating your Outputs, Outcomes and Impact clearly? Are you able to justify your costs if asked?\n\n \n\nWork out any ‘gaps’ in your knowledge, skills or systems that could hold you back.\n\n \n\nMake sure you can keep up momentum – it’s very easy to lose sight of your goals when your workload is heavy. Perhaps signing up to our newsletter, booking into a more advanced course or arranging a meeting with relevant people could help.\n\n \n\nSo, in this Introduction to Sustainable Funding course we’ve covered the ‘income spectrum’ – looking beyond raising money from just one source to thinking wider to all potential sources of funding – gifts and donations, grants, contracts, trading and loan finance or social investment. We’ve taken you through some of the features of each of these and the current trends they are experiencing. And then in this section we’ve placed funding in a wider context, showing you a way you can assess how sustainable your organisation is and explaining some key terms you will need to learn.\n\n \n\nNow you’ve completed this introductory course, it might be that you want to take Sustainable Funding further with one of our more advanced. Or, if you think you need more bespoke or in-depth support, then perhaps consultancy would be more suitable. Again, you can find all our resources, including information about AYMN consultancy, on our website. Many of the tools we use in our training courses are free to download too. I hope you’ve found this course helpful. If you take away only one thing please remember sustainable funding can only be successful when integrated and understood by your whole organisation – it is a team activity.\n\n \n\nThank you.",

        "script": "Global warming is the continuing increase of the average temperature of Earth's surface. But, why is this happening? First, I would like to explain something called The Greenhouse Effect. It is a natural process that warms the Earth’s surface. There are several gases at the atmosphere that absorb some of the radiation emitted by the sun and keep the Earth warm. Without those gases the Earth would be 59 degrees Fahrenheit colder than the present average. For example, Venus, which is closer than Earth to the Sun, would be only about 45 degrees warmer than the Earth if it had the atmosphere like the Earth. But, because Venus has a thick atmosphere made almost entirely of carbon dioxide, its actual surface is about 880 degrees Fahrenheit. That means that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is relative to the surface temperature.\n\nThe Earth’s surface temperature is increasing because we are changing the natural greenhouse. Human activities over the past century have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causing global warming and climate change. In its recently released Fourth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of one thousand three hundred (1,300) independent scientific experts from countries all over the world, concluded there is a more than 90% probability that human activities over the past two hundred and fifty (250) years have warmed our planet.\n\nThe industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised 35% of the atmospheric carbon dioxide normal levels in the last one hundred and fifty (150) years.\n\nResearches suggest that seven countries are the top contributors to global warming. The United States, China, Russia, Brazil, India, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\nSo far, around 35% of Earth’s ice-free land has been cleared for food production causing deforestation, biodiversity loss and water pollution. According to a 2006 report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) found that current production levels of meat contribute between 14 and 22 percent of the 36 billion tons of \"CO2-equivalent\" greenhouse gases the world produces every year. It turns out that producing half a pound of hamburger for someone's lunch releases as much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere as driving a 3,000-pound car nearly 10 miles.\n\nGlobal warming is already having significant impacts on the planet. It is accelerating the rate of sea level rise putting at risk of flooding coastal cities, especially the United States East Coast. Wildfires are increasing because of higher spring and summer temperatures. As temperature increase, more rainfalls, increasing the risk of flooding events. More frequent and intense heat waves, creating serious health risks that can cause heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and aggravate existing medical condition. Rising temperatures also lead to increase the spread of insect-borne diseases and also respiratory problems because of the air pollution. Severe droughts can lead to disruption to food supplies. These things are happening now and they will only get worse if we do not act.\n\nClimatologists are studying different ways to limit global warming. Two methods would be limiting carbon dioxide emissions and carbon sequestration, either preventing carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere or removing carbon dioxide that is already there. In order to do that we must replace energy sources that don’t emit carbon dioxide, like wind, sunlight, nuclear energy and underground stream.\n\nEven when larger companies and factories make the major contribution of carbon dioxide, you still can make a change.\n\nHere are some suggestions that you can start doing now.\nAdjust Your Thermostat\nMove your heater thermostat down two degrees in winter and up two degrees in the summer.\n\nInstall a Low-Flow Showerhead\nUsing less water in the shower means less energy to heat the water.\n\nChange the AC Filter\nClean or replace dirty air conditioner filters as recommended.\n\nInflate Your Tires\nKeep the tires on your car adequately inflated. Check them monthly.\n\nPut on a Sweater\nInstead of turning up the heat in your home, wear more clothes.\n\nIf you follow these instructions you will save thousands of dollars per year and also you will help to prevent the rising amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nLearn more about what you can do at stopglobalwarming.org. We have learned by the scriptures that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass. This is your chance to change the world to a better place.",

        "script": "THE ART OF INFLUENCE: a love story\n\nIt was another hot and humid Malaysian afternoon as we stood for a moment in the cool shade looking over the beautiful young palms on the hillside.   Then a young Asian lady slowly approached us with a shy smile and said, \"do you remember me\".  Now we meet a lot of people around the this big blue planet, but this girl was different.  She spoke with a thick french accent, not Asian.  Our minds flipped through past connections and conventions across Asia and France, but we were drawing a complete blank.  She then saved us from embarrassment as she introduced herself and said \"I am from France, we met when I was 13 in Germany\".  She said we talked to her about our love for Jesus and about our need to love people around the world.  She said those moments with us changed her life.  She told us her story of becoming a follower of Jesus and later studied to become a medical doctor . . .  so she too could help people.  In the shade that day we discovered that she was heading to Cambodia, the land her father had escaped from as a child, to give needy people medical help.  \n\nWow, we never knew!  Our influence in her life continued over 15 years.\n\nBut how does that kind of influence happen?  We believe it starts with \"Love\".  We try to communicate to people of all ages and races from the place of \"Love\".  \"Influence\" is an Art, an Art that begins by understanding what and who are valuable.  If we believe we are the most value persons on earth then we will influence people to serve us, and when everyone thinks they are most valuable . . . we will have total chaos, manipulation and abuse.  But if one's values lead them to believe that all people are created equally important, then influence becomes something for the good of all, not just a few.  Jesus said, \"Love one another. As I have loved you, so love one another.\"  He also said, \"love your neighbor as yourself. \n\nSo we too must love ourself.  This is the balance.

        "script": "THE ART OF INFLUENCE: a love story\n\nIt was another hot and humid Malaysian afternoon as we stood for a moment in the cool shade looking over the beautiful young palms on the hillside.   Then a young Asian lady slowly approached us with a shy smile and said, \"do you remember me\".  Now we meet a lot of people around the this big blue planet, but this girl was different.  She spoke with a thick french accent, not Asian.  Our minds flipped through past connections and conventions across Asia and France, but we were drawing a complete blank.  She then saved us from embarrassment as she introduced herself and said \"I am from France, we met when I was 13 in Germany\".  She said we talked to her about our love for Jesus and about our need to love people around the world.  She said those moments with us changed her life.  She told us her story of becoming a follower of Jesus and later studied to become a medical doctor . . .  so she too could help people.  In the shade that day we discovered that she was heading to Cambodia, the land her father had escaped from as a child, to give needy people medical help.  \n\nWow, we never knew!  Our influence in her life continued over 15 years.\n\nBut how does that kind of influence happen?  We believe it starts with \"Love\".  We try to communicate to people of all ages and races from the place of \"Love\".  \"Influence\" is an Art, an Art that begins by understanding what and who are valuable.  If we believe we are the most value persons on earth then we will influence people to serve us, and when everyone thinks they are most valuable . . . we will have total chaos, manipulation and abuse.  But if one's values lead them to believe that all people are created equally important, then influence becomes something for the good of all, not just a few.  Jesus said, \"Love one another. As I have loved you, so love one another.\"  He also said, \"love your neighbor as yourself. \n\nSo we too must love ourself.  This is the balance.  Too much self love and we are \"better than you\" to little self love and we say you are \"better without us\".\n\nWe believe this balance is best understood as we develop a \"Love\" also for God, the creator and lover of all mankind.

        "script": "If It’s Lonely at the Top, You’re Not Doing Something Right \n \nLoneliness isn’t a requirement of leadership; it’s a consequence of selfishness. If you’re a leader and you \nfeel isolated, then you’re doing something wrong. Great leaders should be surrounded by people who are helping them get to the top.\n\nThis reminds me of the difference between a travel agent and a tour guide. A travel agent will send you on a journey alone. They will give you directions, but only from a distance. From the safety of their own comfort zones. There is really no risk involved, but neither is there any true reward.\n\nA tour guide on the other hand, will walk with you. Step by step. The goal of the tour guide is to lead you on a successful trip and be there with you all along the way. Their drive is to ensure you enjoy the ride as well as grow from your experiences.\n\nOnly self-centered leaders travel alone or work like travel agents. Good leaders, like tour guides, don't want to be alone. They want to take others with them to enjoy the ride.\n\nGood leaders stay close to their people in order to sense their needs and know their dreams. These leaders define success as taking their entire team to the top.",
